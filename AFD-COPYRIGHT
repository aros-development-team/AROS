5. DEVELOPERS INFORMATION
=========================

The concept of a "Standard-Licence" like this one has several advantages:

- You as a developer don't have to think about copyright stuff yourself.
- The users of your product have to read it only if they haven't done so
  before.
- This document is available in several languages via Aminet®.
  So you can be sure that the users have read it at least once and did
  understand it.

If you want to include "AFD-COPYRIGHT"(TM) in your own Amiga® FD-Software
package you have to follow these rules:

a. Read this whole document carefully  and make sure that you agree with the
   whole text WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS.

   (If you do not agree with it, do not use it! You are allowed to copy parts
   of it,  but IF you do so,  you MUST NOT use the names "AFD-COPYRIGHT"(TM)
   and "Standard Amiga FD-Software Copyright Note"(TM).)

b. Make sure that you use the following Default-Tools in the .info-files you
   are going to release:

   - for ASCII texts:           More
   - for AmigaGuide® documents: AmigaGuide
   - for AmigaOS scripts:       IconX
   - for ARexx scripts:         RX          
   - for configuration files:   Ed
   - for Installer scripts:     Installer 
   - for IFF-ILBM pictures:     Display

   (The idea of this rule was inspired by Osma "Tau" Ahvenlampi, Finland.
   It was included to set a standard. If someone does not use these tools
   (s)he has to make not more than one link per file type!)

c. Include a paragraph like the following in the manual to your product:

 ------8<-------------------------------------------------------------------
 This software is subject to the "Standard Amiga FD-Software Copyright Note".
 It is <type_of_software> as defined in paragraph 4<x>. [...]
 For more information please read "AFD-COPYRIGHT" (Version 1 or higher).
 ------8<-------------------------------------------------------------------

   Example:

 This software is subject to the "Standard Amiga FD-Software Copyright Note".
 It is SHAREWARE as defined in paragraph 4s.
 If you like it and use it regularly please send $15 to ...
 For more information please read "AFD-COPYRIGHT" (Version 1 or higher).

d. You have to include this file called "AFD-COPYRIGHT"(TM) (English).
   IF you include an  AmigaGuide® hypertext documentation you can link it to
   this file or include  the whole text  in the AmigaGuide® file just as you
   like. Please do not add more than  two translations  of this file to your
   package. So your package doesn't get too big.
