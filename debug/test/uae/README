This is an example code how to use C++ for automatic endian conversion.
The basic idea is this:

- We create types which mimick big endian (BE) data types.

- We use this base types to access data thus gaining automatic
conversion.

The big plus is here that the C++ compiler can optimize

- assignments between similar types (eg. BE to BE)

- Omit all special code if the CPU is BE

Have a look at types.h for a deeper intoduction.
