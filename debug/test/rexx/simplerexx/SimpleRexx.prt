                   A Simplified Interface into the world of ARexx


          ARexx,  ARexx,  ARexx.    2.0  has  ARexx.   So, why and how do I
          support ARexx?

          The "Why?" has been answered elsewhere and that is not  what this
          article is  about.   Let it suffice that you should support ARexx
          within your application.  It  is  a  standard  that  Commodore is
          pushing and  we hope  that all  new applications  will have ARexx
          support.

          As to the "How?",  that  is  what  this  article  is  about.   We
          understand that  your existing software may not currently support
          ARexx and that some of you may never even have looked at  what is
          needed to  support ARexx.   New applications can be designed with
          ARexx support in mind  and, with  the advent  of the  AppShell by
          David Junod,  the work  involved to support ARexx is nothing more
          than  what  is  needed  to  support   the  features   within  you
          application.    However,  existing  code  may  not  move into the
          AppShell to  easily and  you may  wish to  do a  minor upgrade to
          your application to support ARexx.

          SimpleRexx is  a set  of routines that handle the low-level ARexx
          work for you in such a way as to have your application  work with
          or without ARexx on the target system.  The goal of SimpleRexx is
          to make adding at least the minimum level of ARexx  support to an
          application a trivial task.


                                 Working with ARexx

          REXX  is,  at  its  heart,  a  string  processing language.  Most
          everything that happens in REXX is in the form of  a string; even
          numbers are passed as ASCII representations in most situations.

          The Amiga  implementation of REXX, known as ARexx, and is part of
          Release  2.0  of  AmigaDOS.      ARexx   has   a   very  complete
          implementation of  the REXX language plus the ability to send and
          receive control messages from "outside" sources.   ARexx  the can
          operate  on  them  in  synchronous fashion.  The messages contain
          text strings that are then interpreted by ARexx  as REXX commands
          or by the "outside" source (the Application) as its commands.

          An application  that "supports ARexx" is one that can receive and
          send ARexx messages.  The messages  are, like  the REXX language,
          string  based  and  contain  the  command string of the operation
          wanted.

          To make this even more interesting,  there are  ways to  send and
          receive data from ARexx.  The data can come in the message itself
          or via the ARexx RVI (Rexx Variable Interface).   In  either case





          data  can  be  transferred  to  and from ARexx.  A complete ARexx
          supporting application would need to be  able to  send data  to a
          requesting ARexx program/script and get data from that program.

          The following  code shows how to use the ARexx support library to
          send and receive ARexx messages.  It also  is a  "wrapper" around
          these  functions  to  provide  a simplified interface to ARexx to
          help promote  and simplify  the idea  of adding  ARexx support to
          your existing applications.

          SimpleRexxExample.c is  a very  simple example  of the use of the
          calls in SimpleRexx.  The test.rexx  script is  an example script
          to try  running while SimpleRexxExample is running.  It will send
          commands  to   SimpleRexxExample   in   order   to   control  it.
          test.results is the output of test.rexx.


                                Overview of Functions

          The source  to SimpleRexx  is a single file.  It is SimpleRexx.c.
          The  header  file  to  that  contains  the  type  definitions and
          prototypes for the functions is in the file SimpleRexx.h.

          Functions  that  are  "available"  via  SimpleRexx  are  used  as
          follows:


               rexx_handle=InitARexx(AppBaseName,Extension)

                    This initializes a SimpleRexx context.  The rexx_handle
                    is much  like a  file handle in that it will be used in
                    all  other  calls  that  make  use  of  this SimpleRexx
                    context.    Since  all SimpleRexx calls correctly check
                    the rexx_handle before doing work, you  do not  need to
                    check the  return result of this call.  If ARexx is not
                    available on your system,  SimpleRexx will  just not do
                    anything.


               port_name=ARexxName(rexx_handle)

                    This  function  returns  a  pointer  to the name of the
                    ARexx port for your context.  The name is based  on the
                    AppBaseName  plus   an  invocation   number  such  that
                    multiple copies of an application can  run at  the same
                    time.  If you have no ARexx port, it returns NULL.


               sigmask=ARexxSignal(rexx_handle)

                    This  function  returns  the  signal  bit  mask that is
                    needed for the port that is part of your context.  This
                    should be  combined with  other signal masks to produce
                    the argument to the Wait() call.  This  returns NULL if





                    there is no signal mask.


               rmsg=GetARexxMsg(rexx_handle)

                    This  function  returns  the  next Rexx message that is
                    waiting.  rmsg==NULL if there is no message or ARexx is
                    not around.   rmsg==REXX_RETURN_ERROR if a message sent
                    to ARexx via SendARexxMsg() returns an error.


               ReplyARexxMsg(rexx_handle,rmsg,result,error)

                    This function  replies  the  ARexx  message  gotten via
                    GetARexxMsg().   The "result"  is a pointer to a result
                    string that is  returned  via  OPTIONS  RESULTS  in the
                    RESULT ARexx variable.  If you have no result, set this
                    to NULL.  Error is the error severity  level.   If this
                    is 0,  the result  string will  be returned, if this is
                    non-zero, the error level will be returned in RC.


               worked=SendARexxMsg(rexx_handle,string,StringFileFlag)

                    This function sends the string to  ARexx.   It sets the
                    default host  to the  context and  sets the RXFB_STRING
                    bit in the  message  if  the  "StringFileFlag"  is set.
                    This routine  returns FALSE if the message was not sent
                    for some reason.


               worked=SetARexxLastError(rexx_handle,rmsg,ErrorString)

                    This function uses the RVI (Rexx Variable Interface) to
                    set  a  variable  named  <AppBaseName>.LASTERROR to the
                    ErrorString.  This is where the  "error" message should
                    go if  there is  an error.  This function returns FALSE
                    if this fails for any reason.


               FreeARexx(rexx_handle)

                    This closes a SimpleRexx  context.   The rexx_handle is
                    one that  was gotten  from InitARexx().  The routine is
                    fully error checked so that you can pass it a  NULL and
                    it  will  do  nothing.    This is useful if you want to
                    just blindly use the rexx_handle.
