<h2>XML Source File Location</h2>

When the XML Parser is run (by Parser.parse()), source location
information for each Element is obtained from the SAX handler.

<p>
We use a subclass of org.jdom.Element called ElementWithLocationInfo
which holds linenumber and source file info for the tag.
<p>

Parse.parse() uses the SAXBuilder API, and creates a custom SAXHandler
which saves linenumber info onto the Elements as they are created,
using the getCurrentElement() method which is implemented by the JDOM
library as v b8.


<p>

In order to get the SAXBuilder to use our custom Elements, we use our
own custom JDOMFactory, which instantiates ElementWithLocationInfo
when it's element() method is called.

<p>

When builder.build() is called, a Document is returned which contains
elements of class ElementWithLocationInfo, which are annotated with
their sourcefile pathname and linenumber info.
<p>
The API to get this source file information from an Element is through 
<pre>

Parser.getSourcePathname(Element elt)
Parser.getSourceLocation(Element elt, int coord, boolean end) 

</pre>
