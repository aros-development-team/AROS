<h1>Compilation Warnings</h1>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>A compilation warning is a warning about an error in&nbsp;the input to the 
compiler. &nbsp;Compilation warnings are distinct from compilation errors in 
that the former doesn't prevent the compiler from producing an executable file.</p>
<p>Compilation warnings are represented by instances of CompilationError. &nbsp;They 
are distinguished from errors by the fact that they are passed as an argument 
to a method on CompilationErrorHandler, instead of thrown. &nbsp;A single compilation 
can generate multiple compilation warnings.</p>
<p>Validation warnings and errors are compilation warnings.</p>
<h2>Command-line Behavior</h2>
<p>TBD</p>
<h2>Server Behavior</h2>
<p><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://server/path/to/file.lzx">http://server/path/to/file.lzx</a> retrieves an HTML file that 
includes an &lt;object&gt; element for embedding the swf (which is then 
returned by a subsequent browser request).&nbsp; When 
there are compilation warnings, the retrieved page looks like this instead:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&lt;html&gt;...
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;object..../&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;h1&gt;Compilation Warnings&lt;/h1&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;pre&gt;compilation warnings, maybe several lines of them&lt;/pre&gt;
&nbsp;&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>The intent is that the easiest thing to type in during development, gets 
you the right response.&nbsp; For a deployed app, you've presumably verified 
that it doesn't have warnings in the deployment setting (otherwise 
you've got worse probems than the warnings showing up anyway), and 
you're probably setting the application within an HTML page that you've 
written, and are requesting the swf directly, instead of requesting the 
html that embeds the swf, anyway.&nbsp; More clearly, we define the 
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://server/path/to/files.lzx">http://server/path/to/files.lzx</a> as the syntax for executing the 
application during development, and other syntaxes with more query 
parameters to execute an application during deployment.</p>
<p>A couple of previous behaviors didn't pan out:</p>
<p>Validation errors were compiler errors, not warnings: a request for&nbsp;an 
invalid file retrieved a page that listed the errors, instead of an executable. 
&nbsp;This was too strict: prevented internal developers from implementing ahead 
of the schema.</p>
<p>Warnings were reported in the debug window of the compiled application. &nbsp;This 
was too lax:&nbsp;it was too easy to miss compilation warnings --- when you're using the server for 
development (the only way outside developers get to), and if you aren't 
using &lt;debug/&gt;, you don't get any notification.&nbsp; At one point bug was 
submitted that the compiler accepted text inside an element --- 
actually it generated a warning, but this is swallowed if you aren't 
using &lt;debug/&gt;.
