<h1>View Compilation</h1>
<p>Each topmost view in a view hierarchy is preprocessed, and compiled as
described in element compilation below. LzInstantiateView(canvas,
[encoding]) is called.</p>
<h2>View Preprocessing</h2>
<p>Before a view is compiled, its attributes and contents are modified
through these steps. (Some of these are performed in the
ViewCompiler.preprocess(); some of them are performed inline with
element compilation.)</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;resource&gt; and &lt;globalresource&gt; compilation. TBD.</li>
  <li>Text is measured. TBD.</li>
  <li>The "fontstyle" attribute is compiled. "bold
    italic", "italic bold", and other equivalent specifications
    are transformed into "bolditalic".</li>
  <li>If the view has a cursor or mouse event handler attribute but no clickable
    attribute, it is given a clickable="true" attribute.</li>
  <li>If a layout resource is present, it is replaced by a child
  element whose tag is the value of the "class" property of the layout
  element (default "simplelayout"), and whose attributes are the names
  and values of the other properties of the layout element.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Element Compilation</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>A view element is represented as a JavaScript object with the following
    properties:<br>
    <br>
    children: List of Object</dt>
  <dd>A List of the element's children, except for attribute, method, and HTML
    markup elements. Children are represented using the element
    encoding that this section described (that is, recursively).</dd>
  <dt>id: String</dt>
  <dd>If present the element has an "id" attribute, this
    property is set to its values.</dd>
  <dt>name: String</dt>
  <dd>The element's tag name.</dd>
  <dt>attrs: Object (table)</dt>
  <dd>An object whose containing attributes except id, the event attributes, and
    references, and containing &lt;attribute&gt; and &lt;method&gt; values. The properties of this object are the names of the
    attributes, and the values are the values of those attributes, as encoded
    according to the rules described below under the "Attribute
    Compilation".</dd>
  <dt>attrs.$events: Object (table)</dt>
  <dd>A table mapping event names to functions. Its keys are the names of event properties ("onclick",
    etc.), and its values are the functions whose bodies are the event attribute
    values.</dd>
  <dt>attrs.$paths: Object (table)</dt>
  <dd>A table mapping attribute names to strings.  This table describes
      <code>$path</code> attribute.</dd>
  <dt>attrs.$refs: Object (table)</dt>
  <dd>A table mapping attribute names to functions. For each attribute
    name="value" in 
    the element, <code>attrs.ref.name == function () {with (this) return value}</code>. Attributes of type number or size whose values are not
    syntactic numbers are placed in this object, instead of attrs.</dd>
  <dt>attrs.$setters</dt>
  <dd>Map of attribute names to setter functions</dd>
</dl>
<p>&lt;attribute name="foo" value="value"&gt; and &lt;method
name="foo"&gt; children are placed in the attrs property, as the value
of attrs.foo The value of an &lt;attribute&gt; is the JavaScript expression
in its "value" attribute. The value of a &lt;method&gt; element
is a function with the content of the element as its body. </p>
<p>Text content is placed in both attrs.label and attrs.text. HTML text is
encoded as a string; for example,
&lt;text&gt;&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/text&gt; is compiled as though it were
&lt;text label="&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;"
text="&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;"/&gt;. (There is an optimization
task only to place text in one label or the other, depending on the type of
tag.)</p>
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">Source</td>
    <td width="50%">Destination</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">Element attribute named name</td>
    <td width="50%">attrs.name</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">attribute, property child named name</td>
    <td width="50%">attrs.name</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">text content</td>
    <td width="50%">attrs.label, attrs.text</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Attribute Compilation</h2>
<p>Attribute types are looked up in the view schema. The runtime
representation of an attribute depends on its type. Booleans, expressions,
and strings are represented as themselves. These are the representations
of the other attribute types:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>color</dt>
  <dd>An integer representing the color as hex 0xrrggbb.</dd>
  <dt>CSS type</dt>
  <dd>An object whose properties are the names of the CSS properties, and whose
    values are represented as follows: true, false, integer, and float are
    represented as the corresponding JavaScript types; id and string are
    represented as string (so {a: str; b: "str"} gives a and b the
    same value). </dd>
  <dt>event</dt>
  <dd>A function of no arguments, whose body is the value of the attribute.</dd>
  <dt>number, size</dt>
  <dd>If the value of the attribute is a syntactic number, it is encoded as a
    number, and placed in attrs. Otherwise it is encoded as a
    zero-argument function that returns the value of the attributes value
    considered as a JavaScript expression. The function has a property
    (TBD) whose value is another zero-argument function, that returns a list of
    alternating references and property names that describe the property
    reference expressions that occur in the JavaScript expression.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The value attribute of an attribute element is compiled according to
the type named by its type attribute, if it has one; otherwise by the type
the schema assigns it, the same as though it were an attribute of its
parent. The init attribute of an attribute element is compiled into a
function that returns its value, and is placed in attrs.refs. The
constraint attribute of an attribute element is compiled into a constraint
function (see below) that returns its value, and is placed in attrs.refs.</p>

<h2 id="constraints">Constraint Expressions</h2>
    <p>A constraint <code>width="a.b + c.d.e"</code> is compiled to an anonymous 
function:</p>

<pre>function () {with (this) this.width = a.b + c.d.e)}</pre>

<p>and the anonymous function is given a property named <code>dependencies</code> whose value is a function
that returns a flat list of pairs of reference, propertyName for each property 
that is referenced within the body of the function.  References are resolved within the body of <code>with (this)</code>.  For example, the 
previous example will have attached to it a function:</p>

<pre>function () {with (this) return [a, 'b', c.d, 'e']}</pre>

<p>The view compiler is responsible for embedding the 
<code>a.b + c.d.e</code> within the source <code>function () {with (this) this.width = a.b + c.d.e)}</code>. The script compiler is responsible for adding the dependency property.</p>

<p>The dependency function for an expression that contains a function
call concatenates the result of a call to the dependencies function
for that function.  The arguments to the dependencies function are the
caller's this, and the object that the function is a property of,
followed by the arguments to the original function. For example,</p>

<pre>a.b
  + getMouse()
  + other.getRelative(a, 'b', b)
</pre>

<p>will have a dependency function:</p>

<pre>function () {
  with (this)
    return [a, 'b']
      .concat(getMouse.dependencies(this, undefined) || [])
      .concat(getRelative.dependencies(this, other, a, 'b', b) || [])
}</pre>

<p>Note that the dependencies themselves can have dependencies.  In the case of the first example, if the value of <code>c.d</code> changes, then the dependency on the old <code>c.d</code>&rsquo;s <code>e</code> will be irrelevant.  To deal handle this issue, the dependency function gives the dependency array a property <code>metadependencies</code>, which has the same format as the dependencies array.  The runtime uses these metadependencies to update the dependencies as necessary.</p>

<p>So, the full case of the above two examples is actually:</p>

<pre>
function () {
  with (this) {
    var d = [a, 'b', c.d, 'e'];
    d.metadependencies = [this, 'a', this, 'c', c, 'd']
    return d;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre>
function () {
  with (this) {
    var d = [a, 'b', this, 'a', this, 'b']
      .concat(getMouse.dependencies(this, undefined) || [])
      .concat(other.getRelative.dependencies.(this, other, a, 'b', b) || []);
    d.metadependencies = [this, 'a', this, 'getMouse', this, 'other', other, 'getRelative'];
    return d
  }
}
</pre>

<p>An attribute 'attr' whose value is a number n followed by '%' is
short for a constraint function "immediateParent.a*scale", where a is
x or y if attr is width or height, respectively, and attr otherwise;
and scale is n/100.</p>
