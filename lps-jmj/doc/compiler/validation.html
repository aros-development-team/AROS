<h2>Validation of Laszlo XML Programs</h2>

Validation against the laszlo.rnc RELAX schema is done by the
Parser.parse() and Parser.validate() methods.  We also have a class
called ViewSchema which keeps extra schema information which is not
available in the RELAX schema, such as attribute data types and
class/superclass relations.
<p>

<h4>Dynamically extending the Schema</h4>
We use a fixed predefined RELAX schema which contains
system-defined classes and tags. In order to validate with
user-defined tags, we need to dynamically build a RELAX schema and
pass it to the validator. 
<p>

Before we start parsing a source file, the laszlo.rng schema file is
loaded by the ViewSchema into a JDOM tree (this may be cached in the
future to improve performance).
<p>
When a new class is defined in a lzx source file, it defines a new
legal tag that can be used. We must extend the schema to recognize
these new tags. As we parse new class definitions from a source file,
we add the information to the schema DOM tree as described below:


<p>

Parser.parse() does these steps

<ol>


<li> Parses and builds the JDOM  tree. It then calls parseClassDefs().


<p>

First the laszlo.rng schema file is read in as a DOM tree.
<p>
Then, <tt>schema.parseSchemaAttributes()</tt> is called to  parse out the laszlo.rng schema
   built-in (static) class definitions, more or less. It really just looks for all <tt>&lt;element&gt;</tt>
tags and assumes they are class declarations, and collects their attribute information
similar to how user-defined classes are parsed.
<p>
The details are as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>	
	It makes one pass with ViewSchema.buildReferenceTable to build a table of
	all schema <element> and <define> elements, for efficiency in the next phase.
<p>	
	Then parseSchemaAttributes maps over all <element> tags, following them down
	the DOM and collecting <attribute> declarations. It stops descending the tree
	when it encounters another <element> tag. It also follows all <ref> tags, via
	the table built by buildReferenceTable()
	
<p>	<i>Note:</i> because of the schema format, a single <element> in the schema DOM 
	may define attributes for several "class" names at the same time. 
<p>
	
	As each attribute for an <element> is encountered, an entry is made for it in the
	ViewSchema's ClassInfo map. The type of the attribute is actually looked up
	from the static types list hardcoded into ViewSchema.java, although this will
	change in the future to parse the attribute type info from the schema itself.
<p>
<i>Note:</i> to parse attribute types properly from the schema, we have to <i>not</i>
follow refs for attribute data types, but use the ref name itself as a key for the
datatype; otherwise we'll get primitive validator datatypes instead of symbolic laszlo
data types.

	
<p>
	Finally, when user-defined classes are being parsed, and a new <attribute> declaration is
	encountered in the lzx source file, the ViewSchema.addAttributeDefs() first checks
	whether the attribute has been declared before on an ancestor in the classmap. If it
	has not, the schema DOM is modified to accept this new attribute for the class.
	
</blockquote>

<p>



<p>

<li> parseClassDefs() then looks for top level elements of the form <tt>&lt;class&gt;</tt>
 to parse out 
user class definitions of the form 
<pre>
   &lt;class name="<i>myclassname</i>" extends="<i>superclassname</i>"&gt;
</pre>

<p>
<li> Handle user class definitions.

Call parseClassDefs() to walk the source file DOM tree, and for each
"class" element, calls the ViewSchema.addElement() method to add that
class to the schema.

<p>
ViewSchema parses the Laszlo schema RNG file once into an in-memory JDOM tree. 
The ViewSchema.addElement() method modifies the Schema DOM to add the
new user-defined class.
<p>
Example:  Say we have the following Laszlo class definition

<pre>
  &lt;class name="mywindow" extends="window" title="Class title" 
         onmousedown="Debug.write('class')"&gt;
   ...
  &lt;/class&gt;
</pre>
In this case we are defining a new class <i>mywindow</i> with superclass <i>window</i>.

<p>
addElement() looks through the Schema DOM until it finds the ELEMENT
that defines the superclass <i>window</i>. This can either be an RNG 
tag of the form

<pre>
[1] 
&lt;element name="window"&gt;
...
&lt;/element&gt;
</pre>
or else 
<pre>
[2]
&lt;element&gt;
 &lt;choice&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;someotherclass&lt;/name&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;window&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;/choice&gt;
 ...
&lt;/element&gt;
</pre>

To create the new class definition, we clone the superclass element, and then
replace the superclass name with our new subclass name.
<p>
We then detach the old superclass node from the Schema, and insert a new node
of the form
<pre>
&lt;choice&gt;
  OLD_SUPERCLASS_ELEMENT
  NEW_SUBCLASS_ELEMENT
&lt;/choice&gt;
</pre>
<p>
<li>

<h4> Class Attributes</h4>

A class may declare attribtues using the syntax 

<pre>
&lt;class name="xxx" extends="yyy"&gt;
  &lt;attribute name="rotation" type="number" default="259"/&gt;
  ...
&lt;/class&gt;
</pre>

We convert each attribute declaration into an RNG clause like this

<pre>                       
   &lt;optional&gt;
       &lt;attribute name="rotation" a:defaultValue="0"&gt;
         &lt;ref name="numberExpression"/&gt;
       &lt;/attribute&gt;
   &lt;/optional&gt;
</pre>

except there is a special case if the attribute type is the base RELAX
type 'string' (there's no ref defined for this type), we generate this:

<pre>
   &lt;optional&gt;
     &lt;attribute name="foo"&gt;
     &lt;data type="string"/&gt;
     &lt;/attribute&gt;
   &lt;/optional&gt;
</pre>

We then annotate the RNG class definition element with by appending the attributes list
as immediate children.

<pre>
          &lt;element&gt;
           CHILDREN
         &lt;/element&gt;

         ==&gt;

          &lt;element&gt;
              NEWATTRS
              CHILDREN
         &lt;/element&gt;

</pre>

<p>
<li>
Call Parser.validate() with the source code DOM tree and the modified Schema DOM.
<p>
Since the RELAX Verifier takes SAX Events, not DOM trees, we need to
convert the DOM tree of the lzx source file into SAX Events. 

Parser.validate() uses a helper class SimpleSAXOutputter which takes the
source code DOM tree and emits SAX Events. 

<p>
Since the verifier can only compile a schema from an XML string
source, we also convert the modified Schema DOM back into an XML
string and pass it to the verifier to be compiled.

<p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
The approach outlined above allows the Schema to be dynamically extended with new classes.
This allows the use of new tags for user-defined classes. However, validating the
&lt;CLASS&gt; declaration itself is tricky, because class declarations can contain 
default initial values for attributes. And in a class declaration, 
the set of attribute initial values it can legally accept depends on the  superclass it is extending.

<p>
For example if you have a class "FOO" which has attributes <i>flavor</i> and <i>color</i>, then
you can declare a subclass like this

<p>
<pre>
  &lt;class name="bar" extends="foo" color="red"&gt;
</pre>

In this case it's OK for the &lt;class&gt; tag to accept the <i>color</i> attribute because the
superclass it is extending allows that attribute.

<p>
A trick can be used to properly validate this case, which is to rewrite elements of the form

<pre>
&lt;class&gt; name="foo" extends="bar"&gt;

to 

&lt;__class_foo_$extends_bar&gt; name="foo" extends="bar"&gt;

</pre> 
and to add a new entry to the schema DOM tree for this new pseudo-element, which contains a list of
all legal attributes for the class and it's ancestors.
