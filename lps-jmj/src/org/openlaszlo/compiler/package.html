    <p>Defines the Compiler package.</p>

    <p>This package defines the Compiler class, which compiles an
    application source file to an object file.</p>
    
    <h2>Implementation Notes</h2>

    <p>The implementation of the interface compiler assumes that the
    input file has been validated against a schema.  Reporting XML
    content errors will therefore be centralized at the point where
    the document is validated, and element visitors can assume that
    mandatory elements are present.  Since this isn't yet implemented,
    visitors throw runtime exceptions when an element is missing, but
    the format for reporting these exceptions doesn't need to be
    designed.</p>
