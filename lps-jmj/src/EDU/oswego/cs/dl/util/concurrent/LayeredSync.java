/**
 * A class that can be used to compose Syncs.
 * A LayeredSync object manages two other Sync objects,
 * <em>outer</em> and <em>inner</em>. The acquire operation
 * invokes <em>outer</em>.acquire() followed by <em>inner</em>.acquire(),
 * but backing out of outer (via release) upon an exception in inner.
 * The other methods work similarly.
 * <p>
 * LayeredSyncs can be used to compose arbitrary chains
 * by arranging that either of the managed Syncs be another
 * LayeredSync.
