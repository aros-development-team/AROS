/**
 * This class is designed for fans of POSIX pthreads programming.
 * If you restrict yourself to Mutexes and CondVars, you can
 * use most of your favorite constructions. Don't randomly mix them
 * with synchronized methods or blocks though.
 * <p>
 * Method names and behavior are as close as is reasonable to
 * those in POSIX.
 * <p>
 * <b>Sample Usage.</b> Here is a full version of a bounded buffer
 * that implements the BoundedChannel interface, written in
 * a style reminscent of that in POSIX programming books.
 * <pre>
 * class CVBuffer implements BoundedChannel {
 *   private final Mutex mutex;
 *   private final CondVar notFull;

 * 
 *   public CVBuffer(int capacity) { 
 *     array = new Object[capacity];
 *     mutex = new Mutex();
 *     notFull = new CondVar(mutex);
