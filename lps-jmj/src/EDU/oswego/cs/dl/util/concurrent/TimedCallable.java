/**
 * TimedCallable runs a Callable function for a given length of time.
 * The function is run in its own thread. If the function completes
 * in time, its result is returned; otherwise the thread is interrupted
 * and an InterruptedException is thrown.
 * <p>
 * Note: TimedCallable will always return within the given time limit
 * (modulo timer inaccuracies), but whether or not the worker thread
 * stops in a timely fashion depends on the interrupt handling in the
 * Callable function's implementation.
