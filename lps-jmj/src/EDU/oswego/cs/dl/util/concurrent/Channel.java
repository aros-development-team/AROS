/** 
 * Main interface for buffers, queues, pipes, conduits, etc.
 * <p>
 * A Channel represents anything that you can put items
 * into and take them out of. As with the Sync 
 * interface, both
 * blocking (put(x), take),
 * and timeouts (offer(x, msecs), poll(msecs)) policies
 * are provided. Using a
 * zero timeout for offer and poll results in a pure balking policy.
 * <p>
 * To aid in efforts to use Channels in a more typesafe manner,
 * this interface extends Puttable and Takable. You can restrict
 * arguments of instance variables to this type as a way of
 * guaranteeing that producers never try to take, or consumers put.
 * for example:
 * <pre>
 * class Producer implements Runnable {
 *   final Puttable chan;
 *   Producer(Puttable channel) { chan = channel; }
 *   public void run() {
 *     try {
 *       for(;;) { chan.put(produce()); }
 *     }
 *     catch (InterruptedException ex) {}
 *   }
 *   Object produce() { ... }
 * }
 *
 *
 * class Consumer implements Runnable {
 *   final Takable chan;
 *   Consumer(Takable channel) { chan = channel; }
 *   public void run() {
 *     try {
 *       for(;;) { consume(chan.take()); }
 *     }
 *     catch (InterruptedException ex) {}
 *   }
 *   void consume(Object x) { ... }
 * }
 *
 * class Setup {
 *   void main() {
 *     Channel chan = new SomeChannelImplementation();
 *     Producer p = new Producer(chan);
 *     Consumer c = new Consumer(chan);
 *     new Thread(p).start();
 *     new Thread(c).start();
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * A given channel implementation might or might not have bounded
 * capacity or other insertion constraints, so in general, you cannot tell if
 * a given put will block. However,
 * Channels that are designed to 
 * have an element capacity (and so always block when full)
 * should implement the 
 * BoundedChannel 
 * subinterface.
 * <p>
 * Channels may hold any kind of item. However,
 * insertion of null is not in general supported. Implementations
 * may (all currently do) throw IllegalArgumentExceptions upon attempts to
 * insert null. 
 * <p>
 * By design, the Channel interface does not support any methods to determine
 * the current number of elements being held in the channel.
 * This decision reflects the fact that in
 * concurrent programming, such methods are so rarely useful
 * that including them invites misuse; at best they could 
 * provide a snapshot of current
 * state, that could change immediately after being reported.
 * It is better practice to instead use poll and offer to try
 * to take and put elements without blocking. For example,
 * to empty out the current contents of a channel, you could write:
 * <pre>
 *  try {
 *    for (;;) {
 *       Object item = channel.poll(0);
 *       if (item != null)
 *         process(item);
 *       else
 *         break;
 *    }
 *  }
 *  catch(InterruptedException ex) { ... }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * However, it is possible to determine whether an item
 * exists in a Channel via <code>peek</code>, which returns
 * but does NOT remove the next item that can be taken (or null
 * if there is no such item). The peek operation has a limited
 * range of applicability, and must be used with care. Unless it
 * is known that a given thread is the only possible consumer
 * of a channel, and that no time-out-based <code>offer</code> operations
 * are ever invoked, there is no guarantee that the item returned
 * by peek will be available for a subsequent take.
 * <p>
 * When appropriate, you can define an isEmpty method to
 * return whether <code>peek</code> returns null.
 * <p>
 * Also, as a compromise, even though it does not appear in interface,
 * implementation classes that can readily compute the number
 * of elements support a <code>size()</code> method. This allows careful
 * use, for example in queue length monitors, appropriate to the
 * particular implementation constraints and properties.
 * <p>
 * All channels allow multiple producers and/or consumers.
 * They do not support any kind of <em>close</em> method
 * to shut down operation or indicate completion of particular
 * producer or consumer threads. 
 * If you need to signal completion, one way to do it is to
 * create a class such as
 * <pre>
 * class EndOfStream { 
 *    // Application-dependent field/methods
 * }
 * </pre>
 * And to have producers put an instance of this class into
 * the channel when they are done. The consumer side can then
 * check this via
 * <pre>
 *   Object x = aChannel.take();
 *   if (x instanceof EndOfStream) 
 *     // special actions; perhaps terminate
 *   else
 *     // process normally
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In time-out based methods (poll(msecs) and offer(x, msecs), 
 * time bounds are interpreted in
 * a coarse-grained, best-effort fashion. Since there is no
 * way in Java to escape out of a wait for a synchronized
 * method/block, time bounds can sometimes be exceeded when
 * there is a lot contention for the channel. Additionally,
 * some Channel semantics entail a ``point of
 * no return'' where, once some parts of the operation have completed,
 * others must follow, regardless of time bound.
 * <p>
 * Interruptions are in general handled as early as possible
 * in all methods. Normally, InterruptionExceptions are thrown
 * in put/take and offer(msec)/poll(msec) if interruption
 * is detected upon entry to the method, as well as in any
 * later context surrounding waits. 
 * <p>
 * If a put returns normally, an offer
 * returns true, or a put or poll returns non-null, the operation
 * completed successfully. 
 * In all other cases, the operation fails cleanly -- the
 * element is not put or taken.
 * <p>
 * As with Sync classes, spinloops are not directly supported,
 * are not particularly recommended for routine use, but are not hard 
 * to construct. For example, here is an exponential backoff version:
 * <pre>
 * Object backOffTake(Channel q) throws InterruptedException {
 *   long waitTime = 0;
 *   for (;;) {
 *      Object x = q.poll(0);
 *      if (x != null)
 *        return x;
 *      else {
 *        Thread.sleep(waitTime);
 *        waitTime = 3 * waitTime / 2 + 1;
 *      }
 *    }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <b>Sample Usage</b>. Here is a producer/consumer design
 * where the channel is used to hold Runnable commands representing
 * background tasks.
 * <pre>
 * class Service {
 *   private final Channel channel = ... some Channel implementation;
 *  
 *   private void backgroundTask(int taskParam) { ... }
 *
 *   public void action(final int arg) {
 *     Runnable command = 
 *       new Runnable() {
 *         public void run() { backgroundTask(arg); }
 *       };
 *     try { channel.put(command) }
 *     catch (InterruptedException ex) {
 *       Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // ignore but propagate
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   public Service() {
 *     Runnable backgroundLoop = 
 *       new Runnable() {
 *         public void run() {
 *           for (;;) {
 *             try {
 *               Runnable task = (Runnable)(channel.take());
 *               task.run();
 *             }
 *             catch (InterruptedException ex) { return; }
 *           }
 *         }
 *       };
 *     new Thread(backgroundLoop).start();
 *   }
 * }
 *
