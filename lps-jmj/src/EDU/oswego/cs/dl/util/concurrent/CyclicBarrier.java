/**
 * A cyclic barrier is a reasonable choice for a barrier in contexts
 * involving a fixed sized group of threads that
 * must occasionally wait for each other. 
 * (A Rendezvous better handles applications in which
 * any number of threads meet, n-at-a-time.)
 * <p>
 * CyclicBarriers use an all-or-none breakage model
 * for failed synchronization attempts: If threads
 * leave a barrier point prematurely because of timeout
 * or interruption, others will also leave abnormally
 * (via BrokenBarrierException), until
 * the barrier is <code>restart</code>ed. This is usually
 * the simplest and best strategy for sharing knowledge
 * about failures among cooperating threads in the most
 * common usages contexts of Barriers.
 * This implementation  has the property that interruptions
 * among newly arriving threads can cause as-yet-unresumed
 * threads from a previous barrier cycle to return out
 * as broken. This transmits breakage
 * as early as possible, but with the possible byproduct that
 * only some threads returning out of a barrier will realize
 * that it is newly broken. (Others will not realize this until a
 * future cycle.) (The Rendezvous class has a more uniform, but
 * sometimes less desirable policy.)
 * <p>
 * Barriers support an optional Runnable command
 * that is run once per barrier point.
 * <p>
 * <b>Sample usage</b> Here is a code sketch of 
 *  a  barrier in a parallel decomposition design.
 * <pre>
 * class Solver {
 *   final int N;
 *   final float[][] data;
 *   final CyclicBarrier barrier;
 *   
 *   class Worker implements Runnable {
 *      int myRow;
 *      Worker(int row) { myRow = row; }
 *      public void run() {
 *         while (!done()) {
 *            processRow(myRow);
 *
 *            try {
 *              barrier.barrier(); 
 *            }
 *            catch (InterruptedException ex) { return; }
 *            catch (BrokenBarrierException ex) { return; }
 *         }
 *      }
 *   }
 *
 *   public Solver(float[][] matrix) {
 *     data = matrix;
 *     N = matrix.length;
 *     barrier = new CyclicBarrier(N);
 *     barrier.setBarrierCommand(new Runnable() {
 *       public void run() { mergeRows(...); }
 *     });
 *     for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
 *       new Thread(new Worker(i)).start();
 *     waitUntilDone();
 *    }
 * }
 * </pre>
