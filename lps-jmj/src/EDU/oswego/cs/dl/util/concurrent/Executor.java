/**
 * Interface for objects that execute Runnables,
 * as well as various objects that can be wrapped
 * as Runnables.
 * The main reason to use Executor throughout a program or
 * subsystem is to provide flexibility: You can easily
 * change from using thread-per-task to using pools or
 * queuing, without needing to change most of your code that
 * generates tasks.
 * <p>
 * The general intent is that execution be asynchronous,
 * or at least independent of the caller. For example,
 * one of the simplest implementations of <code>execute</code>
 * (as performed in ThreadedExecutor)
 * is <code>new Thread(command).start();</code>.
 * However, this interface allows implementations that instead
 * employ queueing or pooling, or perform additional
 * bookkeeping.
 * <p>

public interface Executor {
  /** 
   * Execute the given command. This method is guaranteed
   * only to arrange for execution, that may actually
   * occur sometime later; for example in a new
   * thread. However, in fully generic use, callers
   * should be prepared for execution to occur in
   * any fashion at all, including immediate direct
   * execution.
   * <p>
   * The method is defined not to throw 
   * any checked exceptions during execution of the command. Generally,
   * any problems encountered will be asynchronous and
   * so must be dealt with via callbacks or error handler
   * objects. If necessary, any context-dependent 
   * catastrophic errors encountered during
   * actions that arrange for execution could be accompanied
   * by throwing context-dependent unchecked exceptions.
   * <p>
   * However, the method does throw InterruptedException:
   * It will fail to arrange for execution
   * if the current thread is currently interrupted.
   * Further, the general contract of the method is to avoid,
   * suppress, or abort execution if interruption is detected
   * in any controllable context surrounding execution.
