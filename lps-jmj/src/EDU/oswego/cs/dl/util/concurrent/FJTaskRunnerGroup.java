/**
 * A stripped down analog of a ThreadGroup used for
 * establishing and managing FJTaskRunner threads.
 * ThreadRunnerGroups serve as the control boundary separating
 * the general world of normal threads from the specialized world
 * of FJTasks. 
 * <p>
 * By intent, this class does not subclass java.lang.ThreadGroup, and
 * does not support most methods found in ThreadGroups, since they
 * would make no sense for FJTaskRunner threads. In fact, the class
 * does not deal with ThreadGroups at all. If you want to restrict
 * a FJTaskRunnerGroup to a particular ThreadGroup, you can create
 * it from within that ThreadGroup.
 * <p>
 * The main contextual parameter for a FJTaskRunnerGroup is
 * the group size, established in the constructor. 
 * Groups must be of a fixed size.
 * There is no way to dynamically increase or decrease the number
 * of threads in an existing group.
 * <p>
 * In general, the group size should be equal to the number
 * of CPUs on the system. (Unfortunately, there is no portable
 * means of automatically detecting the number of CPUs on a JVM, so there is
 * no good way to automate defaults.)  In principle, when
 * FJTasks are used for computation-intensive tasks, having only 
 * as many threads as CPUs should minimize bookkeeping overhead
 * and contention, and so maximize throughput. However, because
 * FJTaskRunners lie atop Java threads, and in turn operating system
 * thread support and scheduling policies, 
 * it is very possible that using more threads
 * than CPUs will improve overall throughput even though it adds
 * to overhead. This will always be so if FJTasks are I/O bound.
 * So it may pay to experiment a bit when tuning on particular platforms.
 * You can also use <code>setRunPriorities</code> to either
 * increase or decrease the priorities of active threads, which
 * may interact with group size choice.
 * <p>
 * In any case, overestimating group sizes never
 * seriously degrades performance (at least within reasonable bounds). 
 * You can also use a value
 * less than the number of CPUs in order to reserve processing
 * for unrelated threads. 
 * <p>
 * There are two general styles for using a FJTaskRunnerGroup.
 * You can create one group per entire program execution, for example 
 * as a static singleton, and use it for all parallel tasks:
 * <pre>
 * class Tasks {
 *   static FJTaskRunnerGroup group;
 *   public void initialize(int groupsize) {
 *      group = new FJTaskRunnerGroup(groupSize);
 *   }
 *   // ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Alternatively, you can make new groups on the fly and use them only for
 * particular task sets. This is more flexible,,
 * and leads to more controllable and deterministic execution patterns,
 * but it encounters greater overhead on startup. Also, to reclaim
 * system resources, you should
 * call <code>FJTaskRunnerGroup.interruptAll</code> when you are done
 * using one-shot groups. Otherwise, because FJTaskRunners set 
 * <code>Thread.isDaemon</code>
 * status, they will not normally be reclaimed until program termination.
 * <p>
 * The main supported methods are <code>execute</code>,
 * which starts a task processed by FJTaskRunner threads,
 * and <code>invoke</code>, which starts one and waits for completion.
 * For example, you might extend the above <code>FJTasks</code>
 * class to support a task-based computation, say, the
 * <code>Fib</code> class from the <code>FJTask</code> documentation:
 * <pre>
 * class Tasks { // continued
 *   // ...
 *   static int fib(int n) {
 *     try {
 *       Fib f = new Fib(n);
 *       group.invoke(f);
 *       return f.getAnswer();
 *     }
 *     catch (InterruptedException ex) {
 *       throw new Error("Interrupted during computation");
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Method <code>stats()</code> can be used to monitor performance.
 * Both FJTaskRunnerGroup and FJTaskRunner may be compiled with
 * the compile-time constant COLLECT_STATS set to false. In this
 * case, various simple counts reported in stats() are not collected.
 * On platforms tested,
 * this leads to such a tiny performance improvement that there is 
 * very little motivation to bother.

   *     <ul>
   *       <li> A star "*" is printed if the thread is currently active;
   *            that is, not sleeping while waiting for work. Because
   *            threads gradually enter sleep modes, an active thread
   *            may in fact be about to sleep (or wake up).
   *       <li> <em>Q Cap</em> The current capacity of its task queue.
   *       <li> <em>Run</em> The total number of tasks that have been run.
   *       <li> <em>New</em> The number of these tasks that were
   *               taken from either the entry queue or from other 
   *               thread queues; that is, the number of tasks run
   *               that were <em>not</em> forked by the thread itself.
   *       <li> <em>Scan</em> The number of times other task
   *               queues or the entry queue were polled for tasks.
   *     </ul>
   *   <li> <em>Execute</em> The total number of tasks entered
   *        (but not necessarily yet run) via execute or invoke.
   *   <li> <em>Time</em> Time in seconds since construction of this
   *         FJTaskRunnerGroup.
   *   <li> <em>Rate</em> The total number of tasks processed
   *          per second across all threads. This
   *          may be useful as a simple throughput indicator
   *          if all processed tasks take approximately the
   *          same time to run.
   * </ul>
   * <p>
   * Cautions: Some statistics are updated and gathered 
   * without synchronization,
   * so may not be accurate. However, reported counts may be considered
   * as lower bounds of actual values. 
   * Some values may be zero if classes are compiled
   * with COLLECT_STATS set to false. (FJTaskRunner and FJTaskRunnerGroup
   * classes can be independently compiled with different values of
   * COLLECT_STATS.) Also, the counts are maintained as ints so could
   * overflow in exceptionally long-lived applications.
   * <p>
   * These statistics can be useful when tuning algorithms or diagnosing
   * problems. For example:
   * <ul>
   *  <li> High numbers of scans may mean that there is insufficient
   *      parallelism to keep threads busy. However, high scan rates
   *      are expected if the number
   *      of Executes is also high or there is a lot of global
   *      synchronization in the application, and the system is not otherwise
   *      busy. Threads may scan
   *      for work hundreds of times upon startup, shutdown, and
   *      global synch points of task sets.
   *  <li> Large imbalances in tasks run across different threads might
   *      just reflect contention with unrelated threads on a system
   *      (possibly including JVM threads such as GC), but may also
   *      indicate some systematic bias in how you generate tasks.
   *  <li> Large task queue capacities may mean that too many tasks are being
   *     generated before they can be run. 
   *     Capacities are reported rather than current numbers of tasks
   *     in queues because they are better indicators of the existence
   *     of these kinds of possibly-transient problems.
   *     Queue capacities are
   *     resized on demand from their initial value of 4096 elements,
   *     which is much more than sufficient for the kinds of 
   *     applications that this framework is intended to best support.
