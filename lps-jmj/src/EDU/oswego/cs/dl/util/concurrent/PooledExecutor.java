/**
 * A tunable, extensible thread pool class. The main supported public
 * method is <code>execute(Runnable command)</code>, which can be
 * called instead of directly creating threads to execute commands.
 *
 * <p>
 * Thread pools can be useful for several, usually intertwined
 * reasons:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *    <li> To bound resource use. A limit can be placed on the maximum
 *    number of simultaneously executing threads.
 *
 *    <li> To manage concurrency levels. A targeted number of threads
 *    can be allowed to execute simultaneously.
 *
 *    <li> To manage a set of threads performing related tasks.
 *
 *    <li> To minimize overhead, by reusing previously constructed
 *    Thread objects rather than creating new ones.  (Note however
 *    that pools are hardly ever cure-alls for performance problems
 *    associated with thread construction, especially on JVMs that
 *    themselves internally pool or recycle threads.)  
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * These goals introduce a number of policy parameters that are
 * encapsulated in this class. All of these parameters have defaults
 * and are tunable, either via get/set methods, or, in cases where
 * decisions should hold across lifetimes, via methods that can be
 * easily overridden in subclasses.  The main, most commonly set
 * parameters can be established in constructors.  Policy choices
 * across these dimensions can and do interact.  Be careful, and
 * please read this documentation completely before using!  See also
 * the usage examples below.
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dt> Queueing 
 *
 *   <dd> By default, this pool uses queueless synchronous channels to
 *   to hand off work to threads. This is a safe, conservative policy
 *   that avoids lockups when handling sets of requests that might
 *   have internal dependencies. (In these cases, queuing one task
 *   could lock up another that would be able to continue if the
 *   queued task were to run.)  If you are sure that this cannot
 *   happen, then you can instead supply a queue of some sort (for
 *   example, a BoundedBuffer or LinkedQueue) in the constructor.
 *   This will cause new commands to be queued in cases where all
 *   MaximumPoolSize threads are busy. Queues are sometimes
 *   appropriate when each task is completely independent of others,
 *   so tasks cannot affect each others execution.  For example, in an
 *   http server.  <p>
 *
 *   When given a choice, this pool always prefers adding a new thread
 *   rather than queueing if there are currently fewer than the
 *   current getMinimumPoolSize threads running, but otherwise always
 *   prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new thread. Thus,
 *   if you use an unbounded buffer, you will never have more than
 *   getMinimumPoolSize threads running. (Since the default
 *   minimumPoolSize is one, you will probably want to explicitly
 *   setMinimumPoolSize.)  <p>
 *
 *   While queuing can be useful in smoothing out transient bursts of
 *   requests, especially in socket-based services, it is not very
 *   well behaved when commands continue to arrive on average faster
 *   than they can be processed.  Using bounds for both the queue and
 *   the pool size, along with run-when-blocked policy is often a
 *   reasonable response to such possibilities.  <p>
 *
 *   Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes can often be traded off for
 *   each other. Using large queues and small pools minimizes CPU
 *   usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead, but can lead
 *   to artifically low throughput. Especially if tasks frequently
 *   block (for example if they are I/O bound), a JVM and underlying
 *   OS may be able to schedule time for more threads than you
 *   otherwise allow. Use of small queues or queueless handoffs
 *   generally requires larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but
 *   may encounter unacceptable scheduling overhead, which also
 *   decreases throughput.  <p>
 *
 *   <dt> Maximum Pool size
 *
 *   <dd> The maximum number of threads to use, when needed.  The pool
 *   does not by default preallocate threads.  Instead, a thread is
 *   created, if necessary and if there are fewer than the maximum,
 *   only when an <code>execute</code> request arrives.  The default
 *   value is (for all practical purposes) infinite --
 *   <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>, so should be set in the
 *   constructor or the set method unless you are just using the pool
 *   to minimize construction overhead.  Because task handoffs to idle
 *   worker threads require synchronization that in turn relies on JVM
 *   scheduling policies to ensure progress, it is possible that a new
 *   thread will be created even though an existing worker thread has
 *   just become idle but has not progressed to the point at which it
 *   can accept a new task. This phenomenon tends to occur on some
 *   JVMs when bursts of short tasks are executed.  <p>
 *
 *   <dt> Minimum Pool size
 *
 *   <dd> The minimum number of threads to use, when needed (default
 *   1).  When a new request is received, and fewer than the minimum
 *   number of threads are running, a new thread is always created to
 *   handle the request even if other worker threads are idly waiting
 *   for work. Otherwise, a new thread is created only if there are
 *   fewer than the maximum and the request cannot immediately be
 *   queued.  <p>
 *
 *   <dt> Preallocation
 *
 *   <dd> You can override lazy thread construction policies via
 *   method createThreads, which establishes a given number of warm
 *   threads. Be aware that these preallocated threads will time out
 *   and die (and later be replaced with others if needed) if not used
 *   within the keep-alive time window. If you use preallocation, you
 *   probably want to increase the keepalive time.  The difference
 *   between setMinimumPoolSize and createThreads is that
 *   createThreads immediately establishes threads, while setting the
 *   minimum pool size waits until requests arrive.  <p>
 *
 *   <dt> Keep-alive time
 *
 *   <dd> If the pool maintained references to a fixed set of threads
 *   in the pool, then it would impede garbage collection of otherwise
 *   idle threads. This would defeat the resource-management aspects
 *   of pools. One solution would be to use weak references.  However,
 *   this would impose costly and difficult synchronization issues.
 *   Instead, threads are simply allowed to terminate and thus be
 *   GCable if they have been idle for the given keep-alive time.  The
 *   value of this parameter represents a trade-off between GCability
 *   and construction time. In most current Java VMs, thread
 *   construction and cleanup overhead is on the order of
 *   milliseconds. The default keep-alive value is one minute, which
 *   means that the time needed to construct and then GC a thread is
 *   expended at most once per minute.  
 *   <p> 
 *
 *   To establish worker threads permanently, use a <em>negative</em>
 *   argument to setKeepAliveTime.  <p>
 *
 *   <dt> Blocked execution policy
 *
 *   <dd> If the maximum pool size or queue size is bounded, then it
 *   is possible for incoming <code>execute</code> requests to
 *   block. There are four supported policies for handling this
 *   problem, and mechanics (based on the Strategy Object pattern) to
 *   allow others in subclasses: <p>
 *
 *   <dl>
 *     <dt> Run (the default)
 *     <dd> The thread making the <code>execute</code> request
 *          runs the task itself. This policy helps guard against lockup. 
 *     <dt> Wait
 *     <dd> Wait until a thread becomes available.
 *     <dt> Abort
 *     <dd> Throw a RuntimeException
 *     <dt> Discard 
 *     <dd> Throw away the current request and return.
 *     <dt> DiscardOldest
 *     <dd> Throw away the oldest request and return.
 *   </dl>
 *
 *   Other plausible policies include raising the maximum pool size
 *   after checking with some other objects that this is OK.  <p>
 *
 *   These cases can never occur if the maximum pool size is unbounded
 *   or the queue is unbounded.  In these cases you instead face
 *   potential resource exhaustion.)  The execute method does not
 *   throw any checked exceptions in any of these cases since any
 *   errors associated with them must normally be dealt with via
 *   handlers or callbacks. (Although in some cases, these might be
 *   associated with throwing unchecked exceptions.)  You may wish to
 *   add special implementations even if you choose one of the listed
 *   policies. For example, the supplied Discard policy does not
 *   inform the caller of the drop. You could add your own version
 *   that does so.  Since choice of policies is normally a system-wide
 *   decision, selecting a policy affects all calls to
 *   <code>execute</code>.  If for some reason you would instead like
 *   to make per-call decisions, you could add variant versions of the
 *   <code>execute</code> method (for example,
 *   <code>executeIfWouldNotBlock</code>) in subclasses.  <p>
 *
 *   <dt> Thread construction parameters
 *
 *   <dd> A settable ThreadFactory establishes each new thread.  By
 *   default, it merely generates a new instance of class Thread, but
 *   can be changed to use a Thread subclass, to set priorities,
 *   ThreadLocals, etc.  <p>
 *
 *   <dt> Interruption policy
 *
 *   <dd> Worker threads check for interruption after processing each
 *   command, and terminate upon interruption.  Fresh threads will
 *   replace them if needed. Thus, new tasks will not start out in an
 *   interrupted state due to an uncleared interruption in a previous
 *   task. Also, unprocessed commands are never dropped upon
 *   interruption. It would conceptually suffice simply to clear
 *   interruption between tasks, but implementation characteristics of
 *   interruption-based methods are uncertain enough to warrant this
 *   conservative strategy. It is a good idea to be equally
 *   conservative in your code for the tasks running within pools.
 *   <p>
 *
 *   <dt> Shutdown policy
 *
 *   <dd> The interruptAll method interrupts, but does not disable the
 *   pool. Two different shutdown methods are supported for use when
 *   you do want to (permanently) stop processing tasks. Method
 *   shutdownAfterProcessingCurrentlyQueuedTasks waits until all
 *   current tasks are finished. The shutDownNow method interrupts
 *   current threads and leaves other queued requests unprocessed.
 *   <p>
 *
 *   <dt> Handling requests after shutdown
 *
 *   <dd> When the pool is shutdown, new incoming requests are handled
 *   by the blockedExecutionHandler. By default, the handler is set to
 *   discard new requests, but this can be set with an optional
 *   argument to method
 *   shutdownAfterProcessingCurrentlyQueuedTasks. <p> Also, if you are
 *   using some form of queuing, you may wish to call method drain()
 *   to remove (and return) unprocessed commands from the queue after
 *   shutting down the pool and its clients. If you need to be sure
 *   these commands are processed, you can then run() each of the
 *   commands in the list returned by drain().
 *
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Usage examples.</b>
 * <p>
 *
 * Probably the most common use of pools is in statics or singletons
 * accessible from a number of classes in a package; for example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class MyPool {
 *   // initialize to use a maximum of 8 threads.
 *   static PooledExecutor pool = new PooledExecutor(8);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Here are some sample variants in initialization:
 * <ol>
 *  <li> Using a bounded buffer of 10 tasks, at least 4 threads (started only
 *       when needed due to incoming requests), but allowing
 *       up to 100 threads if the buffer gets full.
 *     <pre>
 *        pool = new PooledExecutor(new BoundedBuffer(10), 100);
 *        pool.setMinimumPoolSize(4);
 *     </pre>
 *  <li> Same as (1), except pre-start 9 threads, allowing them to
 *        die if they are not used for five minutes.
 *     <pre>
 *        pool = new PooledExecutor(new BoundedBuffer(10), 100);
 *        pool.setMinimumPoolSize(4);
 *        pool.setKeepAliveTime(1000 * 60 * 5);
 *        pool.createThreads(9);
 *     </pre>
 *  <li> Same as (2) except clients block if both the buffer is full and
 *       all 100 threads are busy:
 *     <pre>
 *        pool = new PooledExecutor(new BoundedBuffer(10), 100);
 *        pool.setMinimumPoolSize(4);
 *        pool.setKeepAliveTime(1000 * 60 * 5);
 *        pool.waitWhenBlocked();
 *        pool.createThreads(9);
 *     </pre>
 *  <li> An unbounded queue serviced by exactly 5 threads:
 *     <pre>
 *        pool = new PooledExecutor(new LinkedQueue());
 *        pool.setKeepAliveTime(-1); // live forever
 *        pool.createThreads(5);
 *     </pre>
 *  </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage notes.</b>
 * <p>
 *
 * Pools do not mesh well with using thread-specific storage via
 * java.lang.ThreadLocal.  ThreadLocal relies on the identity of a
 * thread executing a particular task. Pools use the same thread to
 * perform different tasks.  <p>
 *
 * If you need a policy not handled by the parameters in this class
 * consider writing a subclass.  <p>
 *
 * Version note: Previous versions of this class relied on
 * ThreadGroups for aggregate control. This has been removed, and the
 * method interruptAll added, to avoid differences in behavior across
 * JVMs.
