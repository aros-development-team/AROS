    <h1>Inline Assembly</h1>

    <p>Inline assembly is only enabled when the
    flashCompilerCompatability option is set.  There are two syntaxes
    for turning on inline assembly for a region of source code:
    $flasm...$end, and if ($flasm) {...}.  The first is identical to
    what the flasm tool recognizes; the second allows a JavaScript
    equivalent to be listed in the optional else clause.</p>

    <pre>function f() {
  // some javascript
  $flasm
  "push 'a', 'b'"
  "getVariable"
  "swap"
  "setVariable"
  $end
  // more javascript
}</pre>

    <pre>function f() {
  // some javascript
  if ($flasm) {
    "push 'a', 'b'"
    "getVariable"
    "swap"
    "setVariable"
  } else {
    a = b;
  }
  // more javascript
}</pre>

<p>Labels must be global within the assembly.</p>

<p>More notes from Tucker:</p>

<p>Within an instruction, whitespace or commas are ignored:</p>

<pre>push a b c
push a, b, c
push a,b,c
push a , b , c</pre>

<p>are all the same.</p>

<p>Javascript does not permit multi-line string literal, so you can't say:</p>

<pre>"push 'sd'
 getVariable"</pre>

<p>but you could say:</p>

<pre>"push 'sd'\ngetVariable"</pre>

<p>Permitting the former would be nice, but would take parser work.  Oliver can comment further.</p>

<p>Comments work as in Javascript (// to end of line, /* */ across lines), they can be inside or outside of the quotes.  My intent is that if we can come up with a way to have a multi-line string literal, you could write (for example, using Python string literal syntax):</p>

<pre>"""
  push 'sd'        // This is a comment
  /*
     This is a multi-line comment
     perhaps commenting out some code
   */
  getVariable
"""</pre>

<p>But that's not implemented today.</p>

<p>In general, you should be able to take flasm output, mung it by hand, add comments, then put it all in a string literal and change the line ends to \n, and it will work.  If we add the ability to have multiline string literals to our language, then you can just unconvert the \n's and have pretty flasm code in line.</p>
