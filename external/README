This directory is for packages which are external
AND create binaries in different directories, e.g.
workbench/libs/openurl which creates a library,
a preferences editor and a command.

Exceptions:
* Larger packages which aren't needed by the core
  should go to trunk/contrib.
* if only some additional headers/docs/catalogs/tests
  are created or copied the packages can stay in an
  appropriate directory like workbench/libs.
