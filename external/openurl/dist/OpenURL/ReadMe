This library was created to make it easier for application programmers to
include clickable URLs in their applications, about windows, etc.
Current solutions to this problem typically are to launch an ARexx script
or just support a few webbrowsers, with no room for configuration. This
leads to countless reinventions of the wheel (how many SendURLToBrowser.rexx
scripts do you have on your harddisk?).

This library solves the problem by giving application programmers a very
simple API to handle (one function) and the user gets configurability with
the included preferences program.

OpenURL was originally developed by Troels Walsted Hansen, et al. Since 2005
it is developed by an independent open source developer group. It is released
as a public domain software.

OpenURL is available for OS3, OS4, MorphOS and AROS.

The OpenURL project is hosted on SourceForge. Its project name is "openurllib".
