  * misc: final 7.12 release preparations

2012-11-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * library/api.c: changed the name of the prefs program to the currently used
    scheme.
  * locale/italian.ct: removed lots of unused strings.

2012-08-07 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: replaced all deprecated function call by appropriate replacements for
    the AmigaOS4 build.

#### v7.11 RELEASE #############################################################

2012-08-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 7.11 release preparations

2012-06-19 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * library/init.c: don't allocate locked memory.

2012-04-25 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * locale/german.ct: replaced some "ss" by "ß". This closes bug #3364499.

2012-04-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * Makefile: removed -funroll-loops as this is potentially dangerous.

2012-03-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * src/libinit.c: fixed the broken build for all non-AROS platforms.

2012-01-29 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * misc: backport of AROS fixes.

2011-12-25  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * locale/swedish.ct: updated to the latest changes.

#### v7.10 RELEASE #############################################################

2011-11-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 7.10 release preparations

2011-04-19 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * misc: backport of AROS fixes.

#### v7.9 RELEASE ##############################################################

2011-04-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 7.9 release preparations

2011-04-10 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * libraries/openurl.h: fixed wrong mask value to mask out invalid flags. This
    closes #3283034.

2011-01-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * all/Makefile: fixed the dependency generation to respect the system specific
    object file path.

2010-10-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * dist/Install: adapted the Installer script to respect MorphOS' default
    location for 3rd party libraries.

2010-10-05 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * libinit.c: make sure that removing the library during LibClose() really
    operates on the correct base. Calling LibExpunge() on MorphOS is wrong,
    since that takes no parameter but expects the base to be in A6. We work
    around this by using an additional function which gets called from
    LibClose() and LibExpunge() with the correct base pointer.

#### v7.8 RELEASE ##############################################################

2009-09-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 7.8 release preparations

2010-09-22 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * library/utils.c: added a missing ENTER() statement and let the debug build
    output which command is sent to which ARexx port.

2010-09-08 Mariusz Danilewicz <mandi@interia.pl>

  * AUTHORS: added translators section (please check and update missing persons).

2010-09-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * library/init.c: create the pool with MEMF_CLEAR set to avoid unnecessary
    junk to be saved in the prefs file.
  * library/prefs.c: saving the prefs will now also mask out invalid flags.
  * library/prefs.c: upon loading the prefs file all invalid flags are now
    masked out. This fixed bug #3059088 where the split off MorphOS V8 version
    incorrectly saved some internal flags which then lead to a memory block
    being freed twice when being read again by the V7 library and used by the
    MUI prefs application. The ReAction prefs application was not affected due
    to its different handling of the prefs.

2010-09-03 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * libinit.c: clear all semaphore structures before calling InitSemaphore().

#### v7.7 RELEASE ##############################################################

2009-09-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 7.7 release preparations

2010-08-22 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * library/init.c: lowered the required version of rexxsys.library to V36. This
    fixes bug #3050895.

2010-08-16 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * libinit.c: the library init code now ensures that the entry code is really
    the first code to be executed in case the .library is executed like a
    regular command by accident.
  * include/SDI_compiler.h: updated to latest version.

2010-06-30 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * prefs/Makefile, raPrefs/Makefile: added the .cd file to the dependency list
    of each .catalog file.

2010-06-10 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * library/libinit.c: fixed a warning for the OS3 build.

2010-06-07 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/SDI_compiler.h: updated to latest version.
  * include/clib/openurl_protos.h: added IPTR definition.

2010-06-03 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * Fixes for 64-bit AROS: changes from ULONG to IPTR to get rid of
    warnings about conversion from/to pointer to/from integer with different size.
    Prototype of URL_GetAttr changed. I hope this doesn't cause any trouble.

2010-05-27 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * locale/#?.ct: set some properties.
  * raPrefs/Makefile: added polish catalog generation.

2010-05-27 Mariusz Danilewicz <mandi@interia.pl>

  * locale/polish.ct: fixed MSG_About_Descr

2010-05-27 Mariusz Danilewicz <mandi@interia.pl>

  * locale/polish.ct: added Polish translation
  * prefs/makefile: added generating Polish catalog

2010-04-24 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * library/libinit.c: use NewStackSwap() under AROS, re-enabled stack swapping
    under MorphOS

2010-04-23 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * library/libinit.c: replaced some #ifdef's by macros.

#### v7.6 RELEASE ##############################################################

2009-10-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 7.6 release preparations

2009-09-19 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: added a name to all memory pools for OS4.

2009-09-16 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * prefs/applist.c: integrated the hook structures into the instance data and
    set these after creating the object instead of using global hooks. Thus
    multiple instances of the prefs program will use the correct hook data. This
    fixes bug #2859339.

2009-08-14 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Makefiles: added "-g" to the debug flags. It seems the OS3 GCC 2.95.3 cross
    compiler needs this to generate debug infos at all.

2009-07-21 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * library/libinit.c: in case something in the LibInit() call fails everything
    set up before will now correctly be freed again to avoid memory leaks.

2009-06-16  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * library/prefs.c: changed OWB's port name to "OWB" instead of "OWB.1" because
    openurl.library takes care of additional numbers itself. This fixes bug
    #2801806.

2009-06-07  Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * libinit.c: Merged Staf's fixes from codesets.library

2009-06-07  Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * Makefile fix for linker library

2009-06-02  Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * Fixes for the AROS metamakefiles
  * linkerlib for auto-opening (like it was done for codesets.library)

2009-06-02  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * raPrefs/OpenURL.c: restored accidently removed sections.

2009-06-01  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * raPrefs/#?.c: added the two new macros iset() and gadset() to replace the
    quite long SetAttrs() and SetGadgetAttrs() calls.

2009-05-31  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * raPrefs/#?.c: fixed all warnings and replaced GetAttr() call by the iget()
    macro.

2009-05-24  Alexandre Balaban <alexandre@balaban.fr>

  * raPrefs/misc: made node edition and save/use/apply of prefs functionnal

#### v7.5 RELEASE ##############################################################

2009-05-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 7.5 release preparations

2009-05-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * prefs/app.c: removed the not required AboutMUI method as calling
    MUIM_Application_AboutMUI should really be enough. This should also solve
    the previously existing problems with the AROS compiles.
  * library/applist.c: instead of always returning 0 in mListCheckSave() for
    AROS we now check if the returned pointer of xget(MUIA_List_Format) is
    NULL or not and thus perform the string compare operation or not. This
    should also catch the case where AROS is failing for the MUIA_List_Format
    get operation.

2009-05-28  Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * German catalog sync'd with "FlexCat .. newctfile ..." and updated.
  * Build German catalog with AROS metamakefile.
  * Copying of icon with AROS metamakefiles
  * Metamakefiles cleaned up
  * Overloading of MUIM_Application_AboutMUI disabled on AROS
    because it crashes when closing the about window.
  * Remaining warnings under AROS removed

2009-05-27  Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * AROS metamakefiles added
  * applist.c: fix for a segfault on AROS because MUIA_List_Format
    isn't get-able in Zune.
  * 64-bit fixes (IPTR, STACKED, UL)

2009-05-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include: updated the mui includes to use "muiaros.h" instead of "mui.h"
    for an AROS compile. Otherwise the binaries won't work, I am afraid.
    In addition a little cleanup in the include directory has been performed.

2009-05-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: fixed all remaining compiler warnings when compiling for AROS.

2009-05-24  Alexandre Balaban <alexandre@balaban.fr>

  * locale/french.ct: updated to latest catalog changes

2009-05-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * prefs: slightly updated the About window to match the latest changes and
    to output the correct version string of the preference application.
  * library/prefs.c: added some default settings for OWB, NetSurf, AmiFTP,
    AmiTradeCenter and pftp. If users reset to the default settings of OpenURL
    they should receive a more complete and working set of settings now.

2009-05-20  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * library/api.c: using/applying the prefs always failed due to a missing
    assignment.
  * prefs/*.c: replaced all handcrafted flag checks by macro calls.
  * prefs/popport.c: replaced the clumsy port scanning by a hopefully bullet
    proof version. This new version does not break any Forbid() while scanning
    the public port list.
  * library/utils.c, library/handler.c: replaced the handcrafted message and
    port creation by proper allocations to get rid of the stack based stuff.
    Also shrunk the asynchronous startup message to what is really needed.

2009-05-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * raPrefs: updated the build system of the OS4 reaction preferences to match
    that of our other sub projects. Now the Reaction preferences should work
    as expected on OS4.
  * cmd: updated the sources to be compile/linkable for AROS.
  * include/macros.h: updated to be the global header file for the macro
    definitions of all our subprojects.
  * prefs, misc: now the preference application also properly compiles and
    links for AROS. If it works have to be seen. But it looks quite promising.
  * prefs: fixed MOS compilation by updating the ppcinline header files
  * prefs: converted the build system of the MUI preferences application to
    use the generic Makefile we use with every application. Also converted
    everything to use the SDI headers. OS4 compilation seems to work fine and
    the app seems also to work properly. However, further testing and
    especially work into getting it compiled/linked for OS3 and MOS have to
    be done.

2009-05-19  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * raPrefs/locale.c: fixed possible crash upon program termination.
  * raPrefs: fixed all warnings.
  * Cmd: converted the build system to the usual standard. The commandline tool
    now builds for at least OS3, OS4 and MOS.
  * prefs/OpenURL.c: added debugging initialization.
  * prefs: fixed all remaining issues with the OS3 build. Now the preferences
    program compiles perfectly for OS3 and OS4.
  * prefs: replaced all stccpy() calls by strlcpy().
  * prefs/*.c fixed tons of warnings. At least the OS4 build is done without a
    single warning.
  * library/*.c: replaced all handcrafted flag checks by macro calls.
  * library/api.c, library/utils.c: replace the separate BOOL parameters by a
    combined flags variable.

2009-05-18  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * prefs/popport.c: added a comment about the unsafe Forbid() situation while
    adding items to an MUI list. Just to make sure this is not forgotten.
  * library/handler.c, library/utils.c: replaced the Forbid()/Permit() pair to
    protect access
    to the rexx_use var by usage of the library base semaphore.
  * misc: replaced almost all strcpy() calls by strlcpy(). Also removed the
    custom msnprintf() function as they are longer used.
  * library/api.c: lots of code clean up to make things more readable.
  * misc: replaced several ULONG results by proper BOOL types.
  * misc: added the usual ENTER()/LEAVE()/RETURN() macro calls to all functions.

2009-05-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * library: completely reworked the build system of openurl.library. Now the SDI
    headers are used and a generic libinit.c. All this has been transferred
    from the codesets.library project and should make future improvements more
    easy. Please note, however, that the library needs a lot of testing now
    until we consider a new official release. So please go and see if it works
    with all kind of platforms and applications you have.

2009-05-11  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: lots of type changes to make the source compilable for OS4.
