- Native:
The serial mouse driver should use the serial device instead of the 
serial hidd.

- Big Endian:
The random number generation function srand48(), seed48(), drand48()
etc. have not been implemented for big endian CPUs.

genmf should be able to read several template files. This
would allow to overide debug rules.

inputevent mouse coordinates must be relative and not
absolute

when the mouse is moved every window of every screen
(and the screens itself as well) must have window->MouseX,
window->MouseY,window->GZZMouseX,window->GZZMouseY updated,
no matter if window is active or not, if screen is active
or not, if window is gzz or not, if IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE and/or
WFLG_REPORTMOUSE is set or not, ...                            DONE (Stefan)

during window dragging/resizing (= while the corresponding
gadget is active) Intuition's InputHandler should not execute
any of the defered actions (MoveWindow, SizeWindow, Activate-
Window, ...) in the corresponding queue. During window dragging
/resizing all layers are locked by the drag/resize gadget =
input.device task. But since the defered actions are executed
also by Intuition's InputHandler (input.device task) they
can break the lock = ok = but then the screen can be trashed,
because the window dragging/resizing boopsi gadgets don't expect
that someone else beside them renders into the screen rastport
while they are active. So the window drag/resize boopsi gadgets
(rom/intuition/windowclasses.c) must somehow tell Intuition to
delay the execution of defered actions.

gfx functions must subtract Layer->Scroll_X and Layer->Scroll_Y
from coordinates, not add it!!! Many gfx functions don't handle
scrollx/scrolly yet.                                           DONE (Stefan)

if a certain GUI object (window/gadget/image/bitmap/...) has
a width/height of, let's say, 40, then this means that it has
exactly 40 pixelrows/pixelcolumns!! So if the object's leftedge
is 0, it goes from 0 .. 39 and not 0 .. 40! So to check if
a certain point is inside an object one must do:

  if ((x >= o.Left) && (y >= o.Top) &&
      (x <= o.Left + o.Width - 1) &&
      (y <= o.Top + o.Height - 1))
      
I found several places where this was wrong, and probably
there are more.
