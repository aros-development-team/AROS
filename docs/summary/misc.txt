Datatypes
===========================

  netpbm.datatype
  -------------------------
  I have laying around a netpbm.datatype here.

  It uses NetPBM to load any picture, so we just need to port
  NetPBM (very portable) to AROS to have access to
  every human known pictureformat on the planet.

Oh, but you can link with libcygwin.a and avoid this restriction.
