<section title="How about UAE ?">

<p>UAE is an A500 emulator. Its goals differ somewhat from that of AROS: UAE
wants to be able to be binary compatible even for games and hardware
banging code, while AROS wants to have native applications. Therefore AROS
is much faster than UAE, but UAE has more software.</p>

<p>We are in loose contact with the author of UAE and there is a good chance
that code for UAE will appear in AROS and vice versa. For example, UAE is
interested in the source for the OS because it could run some apps much
faster if it could replace the OS calls by native code. On the other hand,
AROS needs hardware drivers (eg. audio.device).</p>

<p>Since most code will not be available on AROS from the start, 
Fabio Alemagna has started to port UAE to AROS so you can at least
run the old code in an emulation box. Since we concentrated on
writing AmigaOS functions, many functions of the c.lib are still
missing, so this will take some time.</p>
