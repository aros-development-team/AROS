<section title="How compatible is AROS ?">

<p>Most compatible. We expect that AROS will run existing software on the
Amiga without problems. On other hardware (like PCs), the existing
software must be recompiled. We will offer a preprocessor which you can
use on your code which will change any code that might break with AROS
and/or warn you about such code.</p>
