<section title="You should not use Linux or X11 !">

<p>The final version of AROS will not depend on Linux or X11 anymore (but
it will run on them if you insist). Currently, we use Linux and X11 to
speed up development. For example, if I write a new function to open
a window, I can write that single function and need not write hundreds
of other functions in layers, graphics, etc.</p>
