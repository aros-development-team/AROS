<section title="What is this all about ?">

<p>Ok, AROS is a rewrite of AmigaOS 3.1 (Kickstart 40.68 and up).</p>

<p>These are the main goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be binary compatible on Amiga (so it can plug&amp;play replace the
original OS)</li>

<li>Be source compatible on any other hardware (so Amiga software can be
ported to other hardwares with no effort)</li>

<li>Provide every hardware with Amiga apps with native look and feel or,
as the user chooses, foreign hardware with Amiga look and feel.</li>

<li>AROS will come in three flavours: 1) A standalone OS like Linux, Win,
etc. 2) An Amiga Emulation (ie. a window in which you have a Workbench.
Every new screen will open a new window) 3) A link-library with which you
can port Amiga apps to other OSs (eg. Windows). 1) will have Amiga look&amp;feel,
2) will have a mixture and 3) will have native look&amp;feel.
The flavours 1 and 2 will optionally have binary compatibility if
possible.</li>

</ol>
