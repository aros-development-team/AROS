<section title="Why is there no m68k emulator in AROS ?">

<p>To make old Amiga programs run on AROS, we have begun to port UAE to
AROS. AROS' version of UAE will probably be a bit slower then any other
UAE because AROS needs much less resources than any other OS (so UAE
will simply run faster) plus we'll try to patch the kickstart ROM in UAE
to call AROS functions which will give another small improvement.</p>

<p>But why don't we simply implement a virtual m68k CPU to run software
directly on AROS, you ask. Well, the problem here is that m68k software
expects the data to be in big endian format while AROS also runs on
little endian CPUs. The problem here is that the little endian routines
in the AROS core would have to work with the big endian data in the
emulation. Automatic conversion seems to be impossible (just an example:
There is a field in a structure in the AmigaOS which sometimes contains
one ULONG and sometimes two WORDs) because we cannot tell how a couple
of bytes in RAM are encoded.</p>
