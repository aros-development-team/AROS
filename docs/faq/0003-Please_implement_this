<section title="Please implement this feature !">

<p>No. a) If it was that important, it would be in the OS already :-) b) Why
don't you do it yourself and send it to us ?</p>

<p>See, there are plenty of people around who think that their feature is the
most important and that "the AmigaOS has no future if this feature is not
built in right now". We say: The AmigaOS' demise has nothing to do with
missing features. The AmigaOS can do everything a modern OS should do. We
see that there are possibilities to enhance the AmigaOS, but if we do it,
who would write the rest of the OS ? In the end, we would have lots of
nice improvements to the original AmigaOS which would break most of the
available software and worth nothing, because the OS itself would be
missing. So we decided to block every attempt to implement major new
features in the OS until it's more or less done.</p>
