<section title="AROS and MorphOS">

<p>MorphOS is a new PPC based computer system called bPlan.
It runs Linux and an AmigaOS emulator which can run programs
compiled for the Amiga.  The people behind MorphOS and bPlan
are very interested in AROS and have begun to port parts of
AROS' code to their system to fill the gaps.</p>

<p>There have been rumours that AROS and MorphOS have joined
forces. This is not so. The AROS team is still independent.
MorphOS is just using a part of our work. Isn't this what
Open Source is all about ?</p>
