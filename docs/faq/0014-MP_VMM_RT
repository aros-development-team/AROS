<p>Hot themes. Oh well...</p>

<p>Several hundred Amiga experts (or at least what they thought of themselves)
tried for three years to find a way to implement MP (memory protection)
into the AmigaOS. They failed. You should take it as a fact that the
normal AmigaOS will never have something like Unix or WindowsNT.</p>

<p>But not all is lost. There are plans to integrate MP into AROS which will
allow to protect at least new programs which know about MP. Some efforts
in this area look really promising and in the end: Is it really a problem
if your machine crashes ? Let me explain, before you nail me to a tree :-)
The problem is not that the machine crashes, the problems are: 1. If
that happens, you have no good idea why it did, so you have to poke
with a 100ft pole into a swamp with a thick fog. 2. You loose your work.
Rebooting the machine is really no issue.</p>

<p>So what we try to establish is a system which will at least alert if
something dubious is happening and which can tell you in great detail what
was happening when the machine crashed and which will save your work and
*then* crash. There will also be a means to check what has been saved so you
can be sure that you don't continue with corrupted data.</p>

<p>The same with VMM, RT, SMP and RTG. We are currently planning how to
implement them and we make sure that adding these features will be painless,
but they are no #1 priorities right now. A very basic RT has been added,
though.</p>
