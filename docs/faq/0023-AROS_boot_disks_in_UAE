<section title="How can I use UAE to access AROS' floppy images ?">

<p>You must have UAE installed. The boot disk image can be mounted as a
hardfile and then used as a 1.4meg harddisk within UAE. After you have put the
files you want on the hardfile disk image (or whatever), then write it to a
floppy.</p>

<p>The geometry of the hardfile is as follows:</p>

<pre>Sectors    = 32
Surfaces   = 1
Reserved   = 2
Block Size = 90
</pre>
