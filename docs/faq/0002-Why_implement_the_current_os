<section title="Why do you implement the current OS ?">

<p>There have been some talks about writing something which is something like
an advanced OS with the features of the AmigaOS. This has been dropped
for a good reason. First, everyone agrees that the current AmigaOS
should be enhanced, but no one knows how to do that or even agrees on what
has to be enhanced or what is important. Some want memory protection, but
don't want to pay the price (major rewrite of the available software and
speed cut-offs).</p>

<p>In the end, the discussions ended in either flame wars or "do it this
way ! - Won't work because !". So we just said: First we do something we
know to handle. Then we have the experience to decide what is possible
and how. And then we decide.</p>

<p>Also we want to be binary compatible to the old AmigaOS on Amiga. The
reason for this is just that a new OS without any programs which run on
it has no chance to survive. Therefore we try to make the shift from
the old OS to our new one as painless as possible (but not to the
extent that we can't improve AROS afterwards). As usual, everything
has its price and we try to decide carefully what that price might be
and if we and everyone else will be willing to pay it.</p>
