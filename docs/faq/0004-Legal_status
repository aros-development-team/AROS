<section title="What is the legal status of AROS ?">

<p>AROS is Open Source as defined by the APL which is derived from the
Mozilla Public License (we replaced the name "Mozilla" by "AROS" and
modified some text so that all files below the AROS source directory
are subject to the license). <a href="license.html">Here is an online
version</a>.
</p>

<p>If you want to use AROS' code in your own project, you may do so
without paying us a fee but if you modify the source, you must
at least open the interface to the new functionality so that we
can provide a compatible replacement for other users. We also would
like you to state explicitly that you are using our work so that
we can be proud :-)
