<section title="How legal is AROS ?">

<p>Well, European law says "To gain interoperability, it is legal to apply
reverse engineering techniques. It is illegal to distribute the knowledge
gained by such techiques". So what does that mean ? It means basically that
you are allowed to disassemble or resource any software to write something
which is compatible (ie. it would be legal to disassemble Word to write a
program which converts Word into ASCII text).</p>

<p>Now there are of course limitations: You are not allowed to disassemble a
software if the information you would gain by this process can be obtained
by other means and it can be expected that one would use this is other
means. And you must not tell others what you learned. A book like
"Windows inside" is therefore illegal or at least dubious.</p>

<p>Since we avoid disassembling techniques (hey, we want the spirit and not
the bugs) but use common available knowledge (including programming
manuals) which don't fall below the NDA, this doesn't apply directly to
AROS, but what counts here is the intention of the law: It's ok to write a
software which is compatible to some other software. Therefore we believe
that AROS is protected by the law.</p>

<p>Patents and header files are a different issue, though. We can use patented
algorithms (eg. screen dragging or getting a menu when you press the
right mousebutton) in Europe but this must not be imported into the US.
Header files on the other hand must be compatible but "as different as
possible" from the orignal.</p>

<p>Therefore to avoid any trouble we applied for an official Ok by Amiga Inc.
Amiga Inc is quite positive about the effort but they are very uneasy
about the legal implications. We suggest that you take that fact that
Amiga Inc did not send us any Cease&amp;Desist letters (yet) as a
positive sign. Unfortunately, no legal sound agreement could be made
yet besides good intentions on both sides.</p>
