<section title="What programming languages are available ?">

<p>Currently, all development is done in ANSI C. We just use some tools
to automatically generate the C header files (clib, protos, pragmas, fds)
and AutoDocs from the sources and <a href="mmake.html">MetaMake</a>
to build everything.</p>

<p>There are some plans to port at least a C compiler to AROS, so we
could compile code inside of AROS instead of cross compiling but that
will take some time. For example, we need some extensions to C (namely the
Macro Varargs of GCC) to make TagLists work. Then some people are
investigating to port a BASIC dialect to AROS and Aaron Digulla
wants Python. These are still future plans, though.</p>
