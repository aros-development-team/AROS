<section title="What programming languages are available ?">

<p>Most development for AROS is done using ANSI C by crosscompiling 
the sources under a different OS, eg. Linux, FreeBSD or NetBSD. There
is currently no native C compiler that can be run under AROS, but 
there are plans to port one. This however will probably take some time,
so don't hold your breath. ;-)</p>

<p>The languages that <b>are</b> available natively are 
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a
href="http://regina-rexx.sourceforge.net/">Regina</a> and 
<a href="http://wouter.fov120.com/false/">False</a>.</p>

<p>False can be 
classified as an <i>exotic</i> language, so it will most likely not
be used for serious development, although it can be lots of fun. :-)</p>

<p>Python is a scripting language which has become quite popular, because
of it's nice design and features (object-oriented programming, module
system, many useful modules included, clean syntax, ...). A seperate
sourceforge project has been started for the AROS port and can found at <a
href="http://pyaros.sourceforge.net/">this homepage</a>.</p>

<p>Regina is a portable ANSI compliant REXX interpreter. The goal for the AROS
port is to be compatible with the ARexx interpreter for the classic
AmigaOS.</p>
