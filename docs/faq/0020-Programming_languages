<section title="What programming languages are available ?">

<P>Most development for AROS is done using ANSI C by crosscompiling 
the sources under a different OS, eg. Linux, FreeBSD or NetBSD. There
is currently no native C compiler that can be run under AROS, but 
there are plans to port one. This however will probably take some time,
so don't hold your breath. ;-)<P>

<P>The languages that <B>are</B> available natively are 
<A HREF="http://www.python.org/">Python</A> and 
<A HREF="http://wouter.fov120.com/false/">False</A>. False can be 
classified as an <I>exotic</I> language, so it will most likely not
be used for serious development, although it can be lots of fun. :-)
Python is a scripting language which has become quite popular, because
of it's nice design and features (object-oriented programming, module
system, many useful modules included, clean syntax, ...). The current
version of Python for AROS is 2.1.1.
