<section title="For what kinds of hardware is AROS available ?">

<p>Currently AROS is available for Intel PCs with Linux (Linux/i386) or
FreeBSD and Amiga with AmigaOS and Linux/m68. We are working on versions
for SPARC, HPUX, Alpha, PIOS ONE/transAm and any other available
hardware if someone wants to do that.</p>

<ol>
<li>Linux/i386 with 2.x kernel. Status: everything works. Flavours: Emulation</li>
<li>IBM PC Status: Some parts work. Flavours: Native</li>
<li>FreeBSD/i386: Status: everything works. Flavours: Emulation</li>
<li>Amiga/AmigaOS: Status: parts work (like a big SetPatch()). Flavours: Standalone</li>
<li>Linux/m68k: Status: alpha. Flavours: Emulation (binary compatible)</li>
</ol>

<p>There have been efforts to port AROS to PPC and Sparc (Sun) but
these projects did not take off. If you want AROS on PPC, you should
wait for MorphOS because the people behind MorphOS are using AROS to
fill in the missing parts in their Amiga emulator.</p>
