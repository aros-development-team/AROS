<section title="AROS won't make it">

<p>Yeah, we hear that all the day from every person. But most of them
either don't know what we are doing or they think the Amiga is already dead.
After we explained what we do to the former, most agreed that it
is possible. The latter make more problems. Well, is Amiga dead right
now ? I really can't say. Just a few hints: Did your A500 or A4000 blew up
when C= went bankrupt ? Or when AT did ?</p>

<p>Fact is that there is only few new software for the Amiga (although Aminet
has never seen better times) and that hardware is also developed at
a lower speed (but the most amazing gadgets appear right now). I say,
the Amiga community (which is still there) just sits and waits. And if
someone releases something which is a bit like the Amiga back in 1984,
then that machine will boom again. And who knows, maybe you will get
a CD along with the machine labeled "AROS" :-)</p>
