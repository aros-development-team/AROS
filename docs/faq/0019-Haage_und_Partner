<section title="AROS and H&amp;P">

<p><a href="http://www.haage-partner.de/">Haage&amp;Partner</a> have used
a part of AROS, namely the Colorwheel gadget in OS 3.9. So in a way,
AROS has become part of the official AmigaOS. Of course, this
doesn't imply anything. AROS has not become the development branch
of Amiga Inc :-)</p>
