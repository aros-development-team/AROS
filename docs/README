!! THIS IS A BETA !!

New this time:

- First hardware (well, Linux) drivers using the new HIDD technologie
- New license (source is freeware, firms can create commercial products
  with it)
- *Lots* of new code (about 10MB) since the last release.
- *Lots* of new bugs, too ;-)
- Some bugs fixed (well, last time that I mention that)
- IBM PC Standalone version (doesn't do much, yet, but looks promising)
- Many demos from old Fish disks were ported
- New naming scheme

HOW TO USE THIS
---------------

There are two kinds of archives:

    AROS-source.tgz
    AROS-docs.tgz
    AROS-<key>-bin.tgz

AROS-source is the complete source tree, AROS-docs is just a copy of the
HTML pages which you'll find on our site and AROS-<key>-bin is an archive
with the binaries for <key>. Here is a list of keys:

    amiga - Binary for 680x0 hardware
    lx86 - Binaries for Linux/i386
    fx86 - Binaries for FreeBSD/i386
    ibmpc - Binaries for IBM compatible PC standalone

If you are not involved with developing AROS but want to try it out or
(even better) want to write apps for AROS, get the binary archive. It
contains a ready-to-use copy of all binaries for AROS (not that there
were many, yet ... :-). Unpack the archive, cd into AROS and run
the arosshell (NOTE: For some systeme, there are shared versions of the
libs to save disk space. On these systems, you must tell the loader to
look into AROS/lib for additional libs. On most systems, do "export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" (without the "")).

Now you will get a prompt reading "Workbench:> ". Now type "dir all" and
press return and doesn't it look familiar (There will be lots of debugging
output which you can safely ignore. It will go away in the next versions) ?
Try "demowin" to see what our intuition.library and graphics.library can
do. Have you tried "sift" ? This is the AROS version of sift.c which is in
the RKRMs. We just copied and compiled it and it works ! If you want to try
it, copy any IFF file into the AROS directory and call sift with the
name of that file. It will print you the contents of the file using
iffparse.library !

WHERE TO FIND MORE INFOS ?
