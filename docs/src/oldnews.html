Unnoticed, our WWW site has passed 20'000 hits this weekend :-)<P>

<A HREF="http://amiga.eden.it/">AmiWorld On-Line</A> has translated versions
of their AROS article. There is now a german, an english, an italian
and even a japanese version ! Follow
<A HREF="http://amiga.eden.it/index_e.html">this link</A> to the index
of all articles.<P>

We are currently doing a poll on options. Please read
<A HREF="http://www.aros.org/pipermail/aros-announce/2000-March/000006.html">this
announcement</A>.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>9.3.2000</TD><TD>
Over 2000 games have been ported to AROS, yesterday: 
<A HREF="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</A> now runs on AROS :-) Have a look 
yourself at our
<A HREF="http://www.aros.org/screenshots/">screenshots page</A>.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>7.3.2000</TD><TD>
There is now a mailing list for announcements only (basically the same you
can read here :-) Follow 
<A HREF="http://www.aros.org/mailman/listinfo/aros-announce">this link to
subscribe</A>.<P>

Also, the sources for Scalos V2 have been handed over to AROS. Jörg
is lacking the time to give Scalos the attention it deserves and
therefore allowed us to include his work into our contrib area.
No official representative for this work has been elected, yet,
so this is your chance to contribute.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>1.3.2000</TD><TD>
There are still problems to build AROS Native/i386 with EGCS (GCC 2.95.2) which
should be resolved, soon. Some more <A
HREF="screenshots/index.html">screenshots</A> have been added. It's DOOM, this
time. Unlike other Amiga ports of DOOM, DOOM can be run several times on AROS
and you can even play multiplayer games on one machine (not very useful,
though: The keyboard is just too small for four players :-).
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>24.2.2000</TD><TD>
Five new screenshots have been added to
<A HREF="screenshots/index.html">the screenshots section</A> and
(finally), AROS Native/i386 builds again :-) Get your still hot
copy <A HREF="ftp://ftp.aros.org/pub/aros/snapshots">from our
snapshot directory</A>.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>21.2.2000</TD><TD>
There is a new support page for <A HREF="http://free.polbox.pl/a/arosppc/">AROS
for PPC Amiga</A>.  It will be the main contact page for people interested in
AROS on PPC cards on Amiga hardware and especially those people who are
interested in <STRONG>supporting</STRONG> this by <STRONG>working</STRONG> on
it.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>15.2.2000</TD><TD>
A longstanding bug with the dates in the ToC has been fixed (it's not
perfect but better than before).
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>12.2.2000</TD><TD>
The autodocs are now <A HREF="autodocs/index.html">here</A>.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>11.2.2000</TD><TD>
We have begun to move contributed software (for example, examples from
Fish disks and Aminet, the small and big games) outside of AROS.
These things have now their own graph (that's why the size of AROS
became smaller last week) and the code is in <TT>AROS-contrib</TT>.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>8.2.2000</TD><TD>
There is progress on the AROS i386/native front. A very basic VGA.HIDD
has been written plus some additional stuff (timer, trackdisk, etc).
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>7.2.2000</TD><TD>
Code for Menus has been comitted. Unlike on the Amiga, Menus are handled
by a normal task which gets all input events as long as the user presses
the right mousebutton. Therefore, menus don't block, they are very easily
enhanced and the input handler is much more simple. And if blocking menus
ever become an issue, this can added on a per-program basis by looking for
RMB down/up.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>1.2.2000</TD><TD>
AROS will become the development wing of OAF, the Open Amiga Foundation
(what COSA will become). OAF will handle public relations and the contact
to Amiga, they will collect and compile all information and keep us
informed about all important events so that we can completely concentrate
on the development. They will also handle all money and legal issues which
is a very big releaf for us.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>26.1.2000</TD><TD>
We are currently working on Intuition (fixing bugs, integrating things better,
making menus work), the hardware drivers for AROS Native/x86 (vga.hidd
and scsi.device/hidd), commodities, datatypes and AROS Native/PPC. 
Especially for the last one, we need more people who know about
WarpUp and PowerUp. Also, people who know how to write hardware
drivers for a PC (namely how to make Exec handle PCs' IRQs and
a driver for the IDE chips) are needed.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>24.1.2000</TD><TD>
Recent speed tests show that we have reached about 80% of the native
hardware speed (Quake at 320x200 runs at 60FPS with Linux/X11 and
at 50FPS with AROS on Linux/x86). So our speed problems with graphics
seem finally resolved. Also the links and the status section have been
updated.

There are two good articles about AROS on the net. The first one is
<A HREF="http://elwoodb.free.fr/AROS">here</A> (it's an interview
with Aaron Digulla) and the other one is
<A HREF="http://amiga.eden.it/dossier/aros/aros_eng.html">here</A>
(background and some detail info on AROS). This article is a bit
older but it's written very well (and it's also available in
<A HREF="http://amiga.eden.it/dossier/aros/aros.html">italian</A>).
