<chapter id="hidd-model" title="The HIDD Driver Model">

<p>The HIDD system embodies a collection of object classes and a shared
library providing device driver facilities to the &AROS; operating
system. This chapter describes the operating model of the classes and
objects.</p>

<p>It consists of the following sections</p>

<description>
<li><item>Static Model</item>
describing the class structure and properties that make up the
    static device model.
</li>

<li><item>Object Model</item>
describing the object structure and connection oriented approach
    of object linkage.
</li>

<li><item>Dynamic Model</item>
examing the runtime behaviour of classes and objects and the
    lifecycle of a driver.
</li>

<section id="hidd-model-static" title="HIDD Static Model">

<p>The HIDD system is broken up into a collection of classes with a
strict inheritance hierarchy. A HIDD class implements a device driver
for a single device or in rare cases a group of devices and provides
an interface for other programs and devices to access. </p>

<p>In order to maintain portability of interfaces across a wide range of
hardware this interface will in general not present the raw interface
to the underlying hardware. Instead it will present a generic
interface that describes many different hardware implementations. This
allows for the best reuse of both interfaces and code. </p>

<subsection title="HIDD Class Hierarchy">

<p>This reuse is enfored by the hierarchy of classes with common device
functions restricted to a subsection of the hierarchy. An example of
this is disk devices. There are three common disk interfaces available
today - SCSI, IDE and floppy. All these devices provide similar
functions such as the ability to read and write blocks, and determine
the geometry of the disk.</p>

<p>Whilst the implementations of these devices may change the interface
does not. A filesystem needs to talk to a disk-like device, but it
does not care what the underlying hardware supports -- it only
requires the interface.  This idea forms the first part of the
hiearchy structure - and from where the name HIDD comes. These
interfaces provide a hardware independant method of access devices.</p>

<p>If we examine the image above we can see the class tree starts with the
<class>hidd</class> class. This is the base class that all HIDD
classes inherit from. It provides many useful facilities dealing with
initialisation and interaction of HIDDs. A complete discussion of this
class is found in the <a href="hidd-hidd">HIDD Class</a> chapter.</p>

<p>Below this there are a number of different classes, each providing a
different type of functionality. At the moment the diagram only shows
the <class>hidd.disk</class> tree. This contains five entries -- all
detailing slightly different kinds of devices. The
<class>hidd.disk.virtual</class> is a virtual disk device which
provides the ability to address a file as is it were a real device.
Similarly the <class>hidd.disk.ram</class> provides access to a fixed
size virtual RAM disk. </p>

<p>The <class>hidd.disk.floppy</class> provides access to the normal
floppy disk controller. The <class>hidd.disk.ide</class> and
<class>hidd.disk.scsi</class> provide access to common hard disk drive
implementations.</p>

<p>XXX - Where do CD-ROM's and the like fit in? They are like disk
devices, but have some other features that make them different. The
Amiga device structure had them as a disk device but with an extra
interface. I think that this is probably the way to go. But then you
have to differentiate from IDE CDROMs, SCSI CDROMs and the like. In
which case you would use hidd.cdrom... but then you have two
different interfaces on the same level declaring the same
functionality? Does this mean we actually need another level? I hope
not. An alternative would be to hidd.disk.cdrom.whatever to emphasise
that CD-ROMs are like disk devices, but with a few extra functions?</p>

</subsection>
<subsection title="HIDD Device Drivers">

<p>To complicate matters however the above is only half the story. There
is another half of the tree that have different semantics -- providing
access to the raw hardware. An example of this type of class would be
a SCSI controller -- something that is not always accessed by user
programs.</p>

<p>There are however a number of different SCSI controllers available, so
there is more specialisation of classes here.</p>

<!-- img src="hidd-model-class-2.png" alt="HIDD Class Tree Structure" /-->

	    <tree>
		<item title="..."/>
	    </tree>
	</item>
	<item title="serial"/>
    </tree>
</item></tree>

<p>The above picture adds more devices into the class hierarchy. We see
now that there is a <class>hidd.scsi</class> subtree containing a
number of different SCSI controllers. In this case the
<class>hidd.scsi</class> layer provides an interface to the functions
that a SCSI bus provides, and the <tt>hidd.scsi.*</tt> classes provide
the implementation for a specific SCSI controller.</p>

<p>This is still not where the story ends. These SCSI controllers may
have different ways of interfacing with the computer, and may even
have different controllers for different hardware platforms. This
introduces another layer of the tree structure.</p>

<!--img src="hidd-model-class-3.png" alt="XXX" /-->

	</item>
	<item title="serial"/>
    </tree>
</item></tree>

<p>We now see that there are more classes with
<class>hidd.scsi.aha</class> as the parent. These provide different
versions of the SCSI controller. We can see in the example above that
there are three extra classes: <tt>hidd.scsi.cont.isa</tt>,
<tt>hidd.scsi.cont.pci</tt>, and <tt>hidd.scsi.cont.zorroii</tt>. These
allow us to interface to the controller no matter what form of
hardware platform we are using.</p>

<p><tt>hidd.scsi.cont.pci</tt> access the controller through a PCI
interface -- possibly using memory-mapped IO.
<tt>hidd.scsi.cont.isa</tt> access the device through the ISA bus --
using <tt>inb()</tt> and <tt>outb()</tt> style instructions. Finally
the <tt>hidd.scsi.cont.zorroii</tt> device may access the device
through the Zorro-II bus, or in some cases it may only act as an
interface to the ROM-based Exec device.</p>

XXX - a conclusion to that section.

<section id="hidd-model-object" title="The HIDD Object Model">

<p>The class model as described previously allows the definition of
classes providing some degree of abstraction between types of devices
(for example disk devices) and the implementation of those devices
(disk controllers). It does not however address the problem of
connecting the two distinct classes.</p>

<p>Most computer systems have some degree of flexibility about device
connections -- you can add, remove or move devices about. This
possibility allows for device connectivity to change (from the
operating system point of view) every time the operating system
starts. This coupled with the dynamic nature of plug-and-play hardware
resource allocation gives need for a dynamic connection model.</p>

<p>The HIDD system provides this by describing the connections at the
object level. This has two advantages: you can easily reconfigure
the connections at any time -- without having to restart the system in
many cases, and allows classes to be reused easily to support multiple
instances of the same device.</p>

<p>The interconnection model used could be loosely described as being a
bus model. All devices are connected to the object that could be
considered to be their parent in the hardware of the system.</p>

<p>Take the example of a SCSI disk again. The SCSI disk is connected to a
(optionally one of many) SCSI controller. This SCSI controller is
connected to some kind of bus -- for example PCI. Finally the PCI bus
is connected to some central point of the system that is the parent of
all available devices. This is shown more clearly in a diagram.</p>

<p>It is important here to realise that the connection diagram shown
above does not have anything to do with class hierarchies. If we
provide a slightly different version of the diagram showing class
names this should become clearer.</p>

<img src="hidd-model-obj-2.png" 
     alt="Connection of SCSI disk - classes" />

<p>This is arguably the most important thing to remember when discussing
this topic.</p>

<subsection title="Benefits of the Connection Model">

<p>The benefits of this connection model are numerous, providing</p>

<ul>
<li>an easy way to describe the connections described
    between the hardware dependant and independant device classes as
    described in the class model
</li>
<li>a method of allocating and maintaining the resources available on a
    given bus or controller such as DMA channels, interrupt numbers and
    I/O address.
</li>
<li>the ability to add and remove devices at any time. This is useful with
    the increase in hot-swappable devices such as USB devices.
</li>
<li>the ability to enable or disable drivers when their parent device
    is removed or is temporarily brought off line. You may have a USB
    hub with a number of devices connected to it, and you decide to unplug
    the hub. In this case all devices connected to that hub should
    also be removed.

<section id="hidd-model-runtime" title="Object Lifecycle">
<p>A HIDD driver can exist in different states throughout the life of the
operating system. The following section describes all the states known
about by the root HIDD class.</p>

<description>
<li><item>Unknown</item>
    <p>All HIDD drivers start in the unknown state. This is the state
    of a driver when it has either just been loaded into memory, or when
    it is inside the kernel, but before it is first initialised.</p>

    <p>At this point the driver cannot tell whether the hardware it is tied
    to exist, and cannot access the device. There will have been no
    objects created for this driver yet.</p>

    <p>From the unloaded state, the only allowed next state is the probed state.</p>
</li>

<li><item>Probed</item>
    <p>The probed state is entered after the driver has checked whether
    the device exists. Normally a driver will only be in this state
    when the device exists, however kernel based drivers that cannot
    be unloaded will also be in this state.</p>

    <p>Note that the driver still has not allocated any resources and
    there have been no instances of this driver created. It is
    possible for the driver to be unloaded from memory in this state,
    but only under low memory conditions.</p>
</li>

<li><item>Ready</item>
    <p>The device will enter the ready state when it has been linked into
    the system driver list and has allocated any static resources that
    it requires for its own use. It is at this point that instances of
    the device can be created. Whilst it it is possible for the driver 
    to be unloaded in this state, it will only happen when there are
    drivers in the probed or earlier states.</p>
</li>

<li><item>Opened</item>
    <p>This can only be reached from the ready state, but signifies that
    there are instances of the driver created and in use by either a
    user program or another driver. In this state the driver will not
    be unloaded from memory, even under low memory conditions.</p>

    <p>The opened state does not consider the number of instances that
    have been created of this driver.</p>
</li>

<li><item>Removed</item>
    <p>When a removable device has been removed, the driver enters the
    remove state. Note that this does not apply to removable media
    such as floppy disks, but rather removable devices such as PCMCIA
    cards and USB devices.</p>

    <p>This state is not normally used by many drivers, however it is
    available for those drivers that may require it.</p>

    <p>XXX - Is this state really necessary? Or should it be dealt with
    somewhere else.</p>
