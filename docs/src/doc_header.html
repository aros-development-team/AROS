Since I'll go to holidays now, I'd like to thank everyone for
their open and also not-so-open support which makes all this
possible. :-) Thanks a lot, Merry Christmas and a Happy New
Year !<P>

A lot of bug in the new layers library, child window handling, etc.
have been fixed by Georg Steger and Stefan Berger. Since OpenOffice
uses child windows, we hope that
we won't get sued for using the same technology :-)<P>

Henning Kiel has extended the WiMP tool to support child windows.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>17.12.2000</TD><TD>
Thanks to another enhancement by Stefan Berger, layers and windows can now be
set invisible (hidden). Also, layers can now be grouped by priority which
allows to create a layer behind all other layers (for example,
for a background logo and menus which should be before everything
else). We're currently trying to find out how many and which
patents we infringe with this :-(<P>

Johan Alfredsson has ported <TT>SortCopy</TT> from AmiNET.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>14.12.2000</TD><TD>
AROS has now support for
non-rectangular windows and child windows (a window with a dragbar,
etc. inside another window). Kudos go to Stefan Berger for the
code and Georg Steger for input and bugfixes.<P>

Johan Alfredsson improved DOpus a bit and Adam Chodorowski
improved AROS' workbench.

Henning Kiel WiMP, a Window Manipulation Program which allows to
rescure those windows which got lost yesterday :-) It will become
kind of a system monitor in the future.
Stefan Berger and Georg Steger fixed a couple of bugs in the
new layers.library<P>

Georg Steger added a lot of functions to handle regions which
are missing in the original AmigaOS but which should have been
there. These make handling of clip rects <STRONG>much</STRONG>
more simple.<P>

Fabio Alemagna committed a Dhrystone benchmark. According to
it, AROS is about 5% slower than native Linux when run as an
emulation. As soon as we have a native AROS which can load
apps, we'll check how fast a PC really can be ;-)<P>
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>11.12.2000</TD><TD>
Stefan Berger has commited a completely rewritten layers.library which
is much faster and much more simple then the one we had. It's now
based on OO techniques, much easier to extend (we're currently thinking
about child layers and layer groups which will keep their stacking
order). Also, the new layers.library allows to move windows outside
the screen (the first windows have already been lost out there ;-)<P>

Georg Steger committed additional files for ReqTools which should
make it compile on Amiga.<P>

Adam Chodorowski began the work on workbench.library and the
workbench process.
