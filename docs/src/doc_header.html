<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>03.02.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger added the country specific files for all countries
which are supported by the AmigaOS and some more languages.
In the last few days, he made also many demo programs from
Aminet, Fish Disks and other sources work much better (or
at all :-).<P>

Stefan Berger finished GetLanguageSelection() in lowlevel.library.<P>

Johan Alfredsson improved realtime.library and Swedish locale
files.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>31.01.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger improved CreateNewProc() and implemented the
"open options" for console windows (AUTO/INACTIVE/NOSIZE/etc).
He also fixed a bug in the LD-Demon and some bugs related
to DefaultPubScreen handling. There is now C:SetDefaultFont
with which you can set the default font for the system (AROS
uses a much nicer font now than the default Topaz/8). The code
in Intuition has been improved to use this font. Also, AROS
will not open the boot shell anymore if the Startup-Sequence
doesn't print anything. SetLocale now opens the specified prefs
file plus some a lot of bugfixes in locale.library. Lastly,
he added a lot of font-sensitive code in various places.<P>

Notification is implemented but there is no filesystem
which supports it, yet. I sure hope that we get the SFS
sources, soon !<P>

Kjetil Svalastog Matheussen finished the port for PlayMF
(compiles now without error) and fixed a couple of typos
on the MIDI include files. Next, he ported Fireworks,
a tool by Christian Buchner that displays the MIDI data
processed by camd nicely.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>27.01.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger improved the default stack size handling and
fixed a couple of refresh related bugs in Intuition.
He made user specified fonts work correctly with ASL
requesters, various gadgets and MultiView. He also
fixed Ctrl-C/D/E/F breaking in CON: windows.<P>

Stefan Berger added code which allows to scale a layer (ie.
zoom into it :-). Check the winshape and roundshape demo
(use +/- to zoom it; it's slow, though).<P>

Johan Alfredsson finished realtime.library and committed
a demo for the library to test it.<P>

Kjetil Svalastog Matheussen committed a MIDI player (PlayMF
from Aminet) which allows to test the camd.library. He
also fixed some bugs in realtime.library.<P>

Joerg Dietrich backported MultiView to the Amiga and began
working on V44 datatypes and improved his picture.datatype.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>21.01.2001</TD><TD>
Kjetil Svalastog Matheussen fixed a couple of bugs in the
new camd.library and wrote an example MIDI driver for it.
Johan Alfredsson began work on the last datatypes.library function
(LaunchToolA()).<P>

Georg Steger fixed a really very old bug in the task switching
core of AROS (FPU context wasn't correctly saved).
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>17.01.2001</TD><TD>
Johan Alfredsson completed C:Run and Kjetil Svalastog Matheussen
commited a first version of a camd.library (MIDI) and fixed
a few bugs in realtime.library.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>15.01.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger fixed a bug (moving&sizing a window at the same time)
in the new layers.library and improved font copying by the build
process. Johan Alfredsson improved C:Run. Henning Kiel fixed a
couple of bugs in his games.
