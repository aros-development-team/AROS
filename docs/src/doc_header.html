Stefan Berger committed the sources for gtlayout.library and improved
archtool further. He also added some stubs for the pool functions in
exec which old code (for example, the gtlayout.library) expect. Seems
like we need a way to "deprecate" an API :-) He began to port
gtlayout.library to AROS.<P>

Georg Steger committed an AVI anim with a rotating floppy disk.<P>

And some statistics: We have almost completed 75% of the original AmigaOS.
138 developers are registered. At the time of writing, the AROS
sources were 55 MB (that includes all changes ever made to AROS)
and we have 38.5 MB of contributed software (also with changes)
plus several MB of screenshots. Our webpage has almost 80k hits.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>23.03.2001</TD><TD>
Johan Alfredsson fixed the emulation of ACTION_ADD_NOTIFY, ACTION_REMOVE_NOTIFY
and ACTION_MAKE_LINK.<P>

Stefan Berger continued to improve archtool and comitted the sources
for shutdown.library from Aminet.<P>

AROS now boots into the shell instead of waiting in SAD for the user
to start it. With the floppy code, you can now boot AROS from a floppy
disk and actually do something useful with it :-) Horay !
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>20.03.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger wrote a mmakefile.src for BGUI prefs.<P>

Peter Eriksson began work on Font prefs.<P>

Johan Grip added a MultiBoot compliant header for GRUB and
fixed the problem with the intialization of the ide.device.
AROS can now boot from a HD partition !<P>

Georg Steger improved the oop.library which is the base of our
HIDD system and two mmakefiles for BGUI. Next, he fixed a bug
in the mouse detection code which made the keyboard freeze
and made the ide.hidd compile on Linux 2.4.<P>

Stefan Berger fixed BUG 00080 (cd into a file) and added
a new bug in C:Which.<P>

Przemys³aw Szczygielski made tools in C: compile for
AROS Native/i386.<P>

Sebastian Heutling fixed a bug in the trackdisk driver for
AROS Native/i386.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>17.03.2001</TD><TD>
Johan Alfredsson finished DoPkt(). He also fixed ACTION_FIND#? and 
ACTION_END.<P>

Stefan Berger finished AbortPkt() and the mmakefiles for BGUI so it
compiles for AROS Native/i386. He marked all bugs as fixed which are
fixed now. He also reordered the TODO list.<P>

Iain Templeton added some new bugs. The build process will now say
what is not implemented in emul_handler. He removed some old code
from Intuition.library and improved the init code of console and
input.device and exec.library. He removed a lot of CVS log headers
from files in dos.library.<P>

Johan Alfredsson made ACTION_COPY_DIR, ACTION_COPY_DIR_FH,
ACTION_LOCATE_OBJECT, ACTION_LOCK_RECORD and ACTION_FREE_RECORD work.<P>

Georg Steger fixed a deadlock in ExtendFont(). The X11.hidd now uses
dos.library to read the x11keymaptable. The rendering of text to a
bitmap.hidd is now protected by a semaphore. And he improved the
ASL font requester.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>14.03.2001</TD><TD>
Sebastian Heutling made AROS reboot if it cannot read from floppy disk
(so you can now change the disks and boot if the wrong disk was in the
drive).<P>

Johan Alfredsson finished the packet emulation. We should now be able
to run old software which uses DOS packets.<P>

Georg Steger fixed a bug in the gtmultiselect demo, the graphics
emulation (ghosting of gadgets) and the gameport.device. There is
now some intellimouse support. He improved the mouse driver further.<P>

Jonathan Perkin improved configure for FreeBSD (make sure we use
GNU make).<P>

Iain Templeton made the LVOs more simple: Instead of using JMP <addr>,
AROS just stores the destination addess in the LVO table. Since we use
macros for all this stuff, he had just 8 lines to change. He also
fixed a bug for non-Linux systems.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>11.03.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger continued his conquest to kill unecessary debug output.
Good luck ! locale.library can now patch dos.library to use the correct
locale. And he fixed a bug on Examine(). He added localization support
to asl.library.<P>

Stefan Berger improved PS/2 support (mouse/keyboard). Next, he began to
work on an improved version of archtool. <P>

Johan Alfredsson improved the packet emulation system (DOS packet to
Exec IORequest mapper).<P>

Peter Eriksson added a swedish catalog to asl.library and dos.library.<P>

Przemys³aw Szczygielski improved the polish (polski) catalogs.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>09.03.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger made sure that windows don't get closed while menus of them
are still open. Clicking on the screen bar doesn't make the current window
inactive anymore. And he fixed a small bug in our port of DOpus. The
stack is now 40K instead of 8K (just to prevent stupid crashes until
we have some good stack extending code). Some debug output was disabled
and a problem with refreshes on X11 was improved. Tagbases are now
the same as on AmigaOS. There are now german catalogs for dos.library.<P>

Stefan Berger made the floppy drive recognition code work reliable.
He also improved mouse support and the serial and parallel.hidd.<P>

Iain Templeton updated the FreeBSD port of AROS and fixed a bug in
the console.device.<P>

Henning Kiel improved cpak, a tool to make compilation faster (all .c
sources for a library are concatenated into one large file and that
is then compiled).
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>07.03.2001</TD><TD>
Sebastian Heutling has created some floppy images for AROS (a boot
image with the kernel and a boot floppy with an FFS filesystem from
which you can run gtdemo). You can find the images with a
