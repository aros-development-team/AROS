Sebastian Heutlin has created some floppy images for AROS (a boot
image with the kernel and a boot floppy with an FFS filesystem from
which you can run gtdemo). You can find the images with a

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>05.03.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger fixed a couple of bugs in the initialization code of
AROS Linux/x86 and AROS Native/x86. Also commands with input
redirection in shell script should work now. C:ConClip is now
started in the Startup-Sequence. Global variables are now in the
BSS segment and get initialized manually, so they have a defined
value after a reset (otherwise, they would be initilized once and
keep their value after a reset). And a bug in the menu handling in
intuition was fixed.<P>

Iain Templeton fixed a bug in text.datatype, added some new alerts
for our HIDD system and made sure that some more temporary files
are created in the build rather than in the source tree.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>01.03.2001</TD><TD>
Stefan Berger fixed the smearing in DrawGList().<P>

Georg Steger fixed some more ULONGs that should have been IPTRs and the
depth calculations for AROS' screens on X11. Relative mousemovements
are now confined to the screen borders and two apps can now render text
at the same time without trashing the screen.<P>

Johan Alfredsson fixed some bugs in the Dos.library and finished
C:Copy. ENVARC: is now copied to ENV: in the startup sequence so
saved prefs survive a reset.<P>

Henning Kiel hunted a lot of spelling errors down.<P>

Sebastian Heutling made our new filesystem compile when AROS Native/i386
is built. The new native kernel now includes a filesystem ! Soon, we'll
be able to do something with AROS when it runs standalone :-) Also,
the floppy drives are now searched for bootable floppy disks. And some
bugs in the filesystem were fixed.<P>

Peter Eriksson added Swedish translation for Locale Preferences.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>25.02.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger finished Locale preferences. Have a look at our
<A HREF="screenshots/index.html">screenshots</A> !! Definitely
worth a look :-) There is now a demo on how to use the
cool_buttonclass from his coolimages lib. XaoS depends on
topaz/8 font, so it didn't work correctly anymore, because we
use a proportional font now. <P>

Johan Alfredsson fixed a bug in C:SetKeyboard and RAM handler.
IPrefs can now use notification in ENV:Sys/ to update preferences.<P>

Thanks to Stefan Berger, one can now abort packets sent to filesystems.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>22.02.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger implemented FindCliProc() and brought the workbench
background pattern back. There is now a tool to install a pattern.
Locking of Open/CloseWorkbench() should be correct now. He also
committed a batch of new <A HREF="screenshots/index.html">screenshots</A> !
Here you can see our first preferences program: Locale.
There is now a linklib with some icons (used, for example,
by ASL).<P>

Johan Alfredsson finished record locking (mostly untested because
we have no filesystem which supports locking, yet).<P>

Lars Bischoff cleaned S:Startup-Sequence. S:User-Startup is now
supported.<P>

Sebastian Heutling improved his filesystem (removed a lot of global
variables).<P>

Stefan Berger began to work on a packet IO system emulator. As you
might know, DOS uses DosPackets to talk to filesystems while any
other system on the AmigaOS uses Exec IORequests. Therefore, AROS
uses IORequests for filesystems, too (because they are much more
clean in design). Now you can port AmigaOS code which relies on
packets and it will work.

Johan Alfredsson began work on record locking and fixed a notification
bug in RAM handler.<P>

Sebastian Heutling fixed a bug in his filesystem (extending a new
file didn't always work).<P>

Kjetil Svalastog Matheussen improved his CAMD/MIDI library.<P>

Georg Steger added a demo for a register tab gadget.  He also committed an
ILBM-&gt;C converter so we can put images in our software (for example, the map of
Earth in the locale preferences). 
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>15.02.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger wrote the locale sensitve StrToDate replacement and
made IPrefs install them. The workbench screen title is now 
"Workbench Screen" as it should be. Also some bugs which the
test code showed in the date&lt;-&gt;string conversion were
squished by him. Lastly, he added some scripts to start Doom
with a certain amount of players using his netlocal routines.
Makes a nice running demo for AROS :-)<P>

Johan Alfredsson completed notifications support.
