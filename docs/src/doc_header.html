<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>25.02.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger finished Locale preferences. Have a look at our
<A HREF="screenshots/index.html">screenshots</A> !! Definitely
worth a look :-) There is now a demo on how to use the
cool_buttonclass from his coolimages lib. XaoS depends on
topaz/8 font, so it didn't work correctly anymore, because we
use a proportional font now. <P>

Johan Alfredsson fixed a bug in C:SetKeyboard and RAM handler.
IPrefs can now use notification in ENV:Sys/ to update preferences.<P>

Thanks to Stefan Berger, one can now abort packets sent to filesystems.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>22.02.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger implemented FindCliProc() and brought the workbench
background pattern back. There is now a tool to install a pattern.
Locking of Open/CloseWorkbench() should be correct now. He also
committed a batch of new <A HREF="screenshots/index.html">screenshots</A> !
Here you can see our first preferences program: Locale.
There is now a linklib with some icons (used, for example,
by ASL).<P>

Johan Alfredsson finished record locking (mostly untested because
we have no filesystem which supports locking, yet).<P>

Lars Bischoff cleaned S:Startup-Sequence. S:User-Startup is now
supported.<P>

Sebastian Heutling improved his filesystem (removed a lot of global
variables).<P>

Stefan Berger began to work on a packet IO system emulator. As you
might know, DOS uses DosPackets to talk to filesystems while any
other system on the AmigaOS uses Exec IORequests. Therefore, AROS
uses IORequests for filesystems, too (because they are much more
clean in design). Now you can port AmigaOS code which relies on
packets and it will work.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>18.02.2001</TD><TD>
Johan Alfredsson began work on record locking and fixed a notification
bug in RAM handler.<P>

Sebastian Heutling fixed a bug in his filesystem (extending a new
file didn't always work).<P>

Kjetil Svalastog Matheussen improved his CAMD/MIDI library.<P>

Georg Steger added a demo for a register tab gadget.  He also committed an
ILBM->C converter so we can put images in our software (for example, the map of
Earth in the locale preferences). 
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>15.02.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger wrote the locale sensitve StrToDate replacement and
made IPrefs install them. The workbench screen title is now 
"Workbench Screen" as it should be. Also some bugs which the
test code showed in the date<->string conversion were
squished by him. Lastly, he added some scripts to start Doom
with a certain amount of players using his netlocal routines.
Makes a nice running demo for AROS :-)<P>

Johan Alfredsson completed notifications support.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>12.02.2001</TD><TD>
Sebastian Heutling fixed the seek() code in his filesystem and he
implemented FSA_DISK_INFO.<P>

Georg Steger fixed a lot of wrong types in the tools in C:
(in AROS, you must pass an IPTR, not an ULONG if something can
contain a pointer and an int). He also fixed the sequence of
parameters for hooks in locale.library and implemented locale's
replacement of Exec's RawDoFmt(). IPrefs now installs this
patch. That made DirOpus crash, but he found and fixed that bug
immediately. A global semaphore in IPrefs now protects the
patches IPrefs installs so they are installed only once if
IPrefs is started more than once. IPrefs will now patch utility.library
locale sensitive replacements for string functions (Stricmp(),
ToLower(), etc) and dos.library (DateToStr()). Filenames for
languages now have their proper accents.<P>

Johan Alfredsson continued his work on the notification code.<P>

Sven Drieling summarized the m68k-emulator thread. When this works
out, it might be possible to run Amiga code unmodified on AROS.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>08.02.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger continued in his quest to improve all demos we have plus
the code in AROS which is used by the demos. He also improved catalog loading
and fixed a bug in diskfont.library (in libclose). Next, he added some
mountlist entries for our new filesystem and began to work in IPrefs.<P>

Sebastian Heutling fixed a bug in his FFS code.<P>

Henning Kiel made his WiMP tool font sensitive.<P>

Stefan Berger fix a bug in parallel and serial.device.<P>

Johan Alfredsson improved a lot of code which is now used, because we
have a filesystem (for example, C:Info shows now the volumes). Notification
should now work with the RAM handler.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>05.02.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger fixed a couple of bugs in the graphics.library (AreaFill)
and improved locale a bit (if no language could be loaded, say that
english, which is compiled in, is being used). He also improved some
old demos from Fish disks and fixed some bugs in exec semaphores and
c.lib/sscanf(). While improving the fish disk demos, he found a design
fault in MathFFP (sometimes, ULONG is used and sometimes float).
Lastly, he improved the bool gadgets, added support for the suomi
language.<P>

Stefan Berger helped to discover the MathFFP design fault.<P>

Kjetil Svalastog Matheussen improved camd.library.<P>

Michael Schulz improved the boot code for AROS i386/Native. The AROS
kernel can now be upto 1.2MB (err, no, AROS doesn't need that much.
It's just that we have no filesystem, yet, and therefore cannot
load any libraries from disk, so for the time being, they must be
compiled in :-)<P>

Sebastian Heutling committed our first filesystem. Since we haven't
got the sources for SFS as we hoped, our first filesystem is FFS.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>03.02.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger added the country specific files for all countries
which are supported by the AmigaOS and some more languages.
In the last few days, he made also many demo programs from
Aminet, Fish Disks and other sources work much better (or
at all :-).<P>

Stefan Berger finished GetLanguageSelection() in lowlevel.library.<P>

Johan Alfredsson improved realtime.library and Swedish locale
files.
