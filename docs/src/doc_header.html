<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>15.01.2001</TD><TD>
Georg Steger fixed a bug (moving&sizing a window at the same time)
in the new layers.library and improved font copying by the build
process. Johan Alfredsson improved C:Run. Henning Kiel fixed a
couple of bugs in his games. 
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>12.01.2001</TD><TD>
Adam Chodorowski made C:Ping compile (it would work if there
were a TCP/IP stack :-). Also, the About window of LoadWB shows
the AROS license now. Georg Steger improved the Graphics.HIDD,
font handling, DOpus and DataTypes. He and Johan Alfredsson fixed the
RAW: bug in console.device.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>09.01.2001</TD><TD>
Aaron Digulla fixed a bug which broke the nightly builds and Michael
Schulz began to commit the new AROS i386/Native core. AROS uses now
GRUB to boot. Georg Steger began to implement the ASL Font requester.
He and Johan Alfredsson also fixed a few compiler warnings.
To test the new font requester, Georg committed some PD TrueType
fonts.
Peter Hans van den Muijzenberg improved the ideas for a MMU.HIDD.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>06.01.2001</TD><TD>
Johan Alfredsson improved C:Info and FPutC() and fixed a bug
in DOS. Flavio Stanchina improved INSTALL.amiga and 
Adam Chodorowski worked a bit in the new socket.library.
He committed the network includes from OpenBSD 2.7, so we
at least have an interface definition for a 100% compatible
TCP/IP stack. Only the stack itself is still missing :-)
Iain Templeton made AROS compile on FreeBSD again, 
Johan Alfredsson completed C:NewShell, Georg Steger fixed
a bug in MultiView, the text.datatype and Intuition.
Lars Bischoff added support for hi- and true-color screens
in DisplayBeep().<P>

Adam Chodorowski committed some tools from the GPL:ed AmiTCP-3.0b
sources as found on AmiNET and used these to fix bugs in the
new network includes. bsdsocket.library compiles now without
errors but still doesn't do anything useful. Georg Steger made
the new layers.library a bit more compatible with the AmigaOS
and Henning Kiel fixed a bug with DisplayBeep().
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>03.01.2001</TD><TD>
Adam Chodorowski ported the new V44+ prefs header files to AROS.
Georg Steger and Flavio Stanchina fixed a couple of bugs.
Johan Alfredsson committed C:Eval and Henning Kiel added the
neccessary code to compile it. They also fixed some more bugs
in the docs and DOS.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>01.01.2001</TD><TD>
Happy New Year, everyone ! :-)<P>

Adam Chodorowski began to hunt a bug in RAW: and committed a skeleton
for a skeleton for bsdsocket.library. The includes are there but
all functions are empty. Then, he improved his LoadWB command. Henning Kiel
helped him and then fixed all the lint in the docs (email addresses, etc).
Georg Steger began to improve the RAW mode of the console. Johan Alfredsson
fixed a bug in the c.lib and C:Dir.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>28.12.2000</TD><TD>
Georg Steger worked a bit more in the backport of reqtools to AmigaOS.
Johan Alfredsson implemented DisplayError() and Stefan Berger improved
his layers.library. DisplayBeep() works now and Henning Kiel committed
a small utility (C:Beep) to use it from the shell. Adam Chodorowski
continued his work on the workbench.library.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>26.12.2000</TD><TD>
Johan Alfredsson rewrote C:List (everything except the ALL option works
now). WiMP can now show some info about windows and screens, thanks
to Henning Kiel. Flavio Stanchina continues in his quest to squish
bugs in header and the build process and Stefan Berger applied some
refactoring to his layers.library. Georg Steger did the same with
the serial, parallel and UnixIO HIDDs. Stefan Berger supported this
by adding a couple of skeletons for the hardware interfaces of the
HIDDs.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>24.12.2000</TD><TD>
Flavio Stanchina fixed bugs in the build process and some header files.
Johan Alfredsson finished the C:Info command. Georg Steger improved
the shape window demo (you can now switch the shape on and off) and
fixed a bug in AmigaTerm. Stefan Berger found a couple of patents
which seem to apply on child windows so he removed the child window
code again. If someone knows that this is free technology, we
would be grateful for the information !
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>22.12.2000</TD><TD>
Since I'll go to holidays now, I'd like to thank everyone for
their open and also not-so-open support which makes all this
possible. :-) Thanks a lot, Merry Christmas and a Happy New
Year !<P>
