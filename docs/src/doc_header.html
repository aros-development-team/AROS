<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>11.12.2000</TD><TD>
Stefan Berger has commited a completely rewritten layers.library which
is much faster and much more simple then the one we had. It's now
based on OO techniques, much easier to extend (we're currently thinking
about child layers and layer groups which will keep their stacking
order). Also, the new layers.library allows to move windows outside
the screen (the first windows have already been lost out there ;-)<P>

Georg Steger committed additional files for ReqTools which should
make it compile on Amiga.<P>

Adam Chodorowski began the work on workbench.library and the
workbench process.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>9.12.2000</TD><TD>
Johan Alfredsson improved the ReqTools file requester. The Volume requester
works now.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>6.12.2000</TD><TD>
Michael Schulz committed a PS/2 Mouse.HIDD and removed the respective
code in the keyboard handler.<P>

Adam Chodorowski implemented the Intuition-Functions OpenWorkbench()
and CloseWorkbench(). LockPubScreen() will now open the workbench
if it isn't already open.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>3.12.2000</TD><TD>
Johan Alfredsson added a couple of function to dos.library.
Georg Steger fixed a couple of bugs in the ASL ScreenMode
requester and made the close button in the X11 Window
kill AROS. He also committed a 3D Space Invaders clone.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>30.11.2000</TD><TD>
Michael Schulz is back and has begun to work on an abstract Mouse.HIDD for AROS
x86/Native. Georg Steger finished porting of reqtools.library and ports now all
the reqtools utilities (prefs program) and updated all AROS programs which use
reqtools (for example, MultiView and the text.datatype). He also fixed a few
bugs in diskfont.library and FixFonts, in Intuition and Gadtools.  Adam
Chodorowski is working on LoadWB.  Johan Alfredsson and Stefan Berger have
finished more and more CLI commands. Henning Kiel is working together
with the author of plex86 to make AROS work with plex86. AROS boots
but it crashes soon after.
