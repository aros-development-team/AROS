BGUI has been completely ported to AROS, now. This means that the library
can be compiled and that all demos run. Cudos go to Stefan Berger.<P>

Michael Schulz is working on making mice work on AROS Native/i386.
This includes work on a PCI.HIDD, an IRQ.HIDD, the VGA.HIDD and the
Serial.HIDD plus an IDE driver. Trackdisk is there, too, so the
next thing is to find a filesystem to use. We try to get SFS because
it seems one of the best filesystems for the Amiga at this time.
The SFS developers seem to be very positive to this, we'll see what
comes from it.<P>

As for the <A HREF="http://www.sowatec.com/">Sowatec AG</A> hiring
developers for AROS, all I can say at this time is that we had several
job interviews and things look quite good. The only thing that might
break it at this time (as I see it) is that we get not enough people.
We figured that we need four developers and last I looked, we had three
and one interview still open. Don't hold your breath but press your
thumbs :-)<P>

Nils Henrik Lorentzen has begun to write a framebuffer.HIDD which
uses Linux' framebuffer for rendering. Right now, it's mostly for
debugging (it's a synchronous interface instead of X11s' asynchronous
one) but maybe, there will be a AROS Native/linux-i386, ie. a
version of AROS that will boot with the help of a Linux kernel
but without the need to install a complete Linux system. We'll
see what can be done here.<P>

And I'm diving into the depths of Ami, the SDK for the next Amiga
by <A HREF="http://www.amiga.com/">Amiga Inc.</A>. As it looks, the
SDK is a bit disappointing because it's very rough and has lots of
holes but on the positive side, Amiga's crew is very helpful and
the developer support is just great. *sigh* Had we just had such
a support in the old C= days. Many thanks for their effort go to
Ray A. Akey and Gary Peake and all the members of the 
<A HREF="http://www.tao-group.com/">Tao</A> and Amiga
support staff that I'm bombing with EMails ;-) If they can keep this
attitude, then I have no doubt that in five or ten years, people
will name Ami in the same breath as Windows, EPOC and Linux.
Something really to look forward to.<P>

As for stats, I'm proud that we made 40k hits on our web page and
this year has also been very productive from the EMail side: Last
year, there were about 300KB mails/month in the developer list.
This year, we have 1MB mails/month ! Thanks go to all those
members of the development team that have not been mentioned here
but who do important stuff, nonetheless (in no order): Henning
Kiel and Lars Bischoff for reporting bugs, Georg Steger for
cleaning up after the other developers have raged through the
code and calling me back to earth when necessary, Jaime Dias for
asking "stupid" questions that make us think what we're doing,
Manuel Lemos for trusting us with BGUI, Requin Frederic for
helping Michael Schulz, Tobias Seiler for continuing the NetBSD
port, Bernardo Innocenti for bugging people to allow us to port
their software to AROS and last but not least all those people
who I forgot :-) Thanks to you all; it's <strong>your</strong>
work that makes this possible.<P>

And at the end, a short note to all those people who started own
ports of the AmigaOS: Good luck to you all. I think you will find
out soon enough why AROS took soo long. The AROS team is still
willing to share their knowledge and code with everyone out
there. And we can do this because of the MPL, the only true Open
Source license :-)

Some new software is ported to AROS: The freetype library
(<A HREF="http://www.freetype.org">www.freetype.org</A>),
BGUI and SnoopDOS. Also DOpus becomes more and more usable.
Many bugs in the Gfx.HIDD were fixed and there is now a
quite usable cybergrafx.library. Also the first version
of an IDE driver for x86/Native was committed. Also
a trackdisk.device is there, so we can start porting
a filesystem to AROS.<P>

As for BGUI, we would like someone who will keep it alive on
Amiga (that is, make sure that our changes don't make BGUI
unusable on the Amiga). If you want to help, please contact
<A HREF="mailto:digulla@aros.org">digulla@aros.org</A>.<P>

Also please note that my PGP-key has changed (2048bit instead
of only 1024bit for better security :-). You find my new version
<A HREF="pubkey.asc">here</A> (Shift-Click on the link to download).<P>

Lastly, my Amiga SDK has arrived. You can expect an AROS Amie/Native
but probably not soon.<P>

<I>Note: This is an old announcement which I fogot to copy on the
WWW site. Sorry for that :-(</I><P>

There was no status update for more than 6 weeks (which is too much).
I'll do better in the future :-) In the last few days, our WWW counter
silently skipped 33.333 hits.<P>

The Sowatec AG has decided to give AROS a chance. Several people who
applied for the job to work on AROS have been contacted to arrange for
job interviews. That means for me that I will finally be able to meet
some of the people I worked with for the last five years ;-) It doesn't
mean that there will be an AROS development team in Switzerland, though.
So don't hope for too much, yet :-)<P>

Unfortunately, the date for the World of Alternatives is very unlucky
for me; I'll return from my holidays on Saturday and therefore, I'll
not be able to attend :-( Since the World of Amiga in Cologne seems
to be a dead event this year (Who's left to attend ? Who is willing
to attend ??) I'll try to make it the London Amiga show or whatever
is held this or early next year. Sorry if you did expect me to show
up :-)<P>

On a more happy news, BGUI has been handed over to us and integrated
into AROS (you can download the contrib sources for your copy). Manuel
Lemus promised me that it compiles on Amiga but, unfortunately, it
doesn't compile on AROS, yet (the old lack-of-manpower problem). There
should be no major problems, though and porting has started. I just
can't say when it will be finished. Anyone wanting to work on BGUI
only (and not on AROS) should still apply for a CVS account to
synchronise his work with ours.<P>

Also, Steve Crietzman of the Open Amiga Foundation seems to be pretty
far with finding out which legal obstacles could hurt AROS/Lite. His
effort is currently blocked by the effort of the Sowatec AG to found
an AROS development team (we'll have to sort our legal obstacles first).
As usual, the legal dept. drains all the energies ;-)<P>

On the AROS side, work is still progressing, maybe even at a faster
pace than usual ;-) The AROS Native/i386 flavour is currently broken
(the HIDD system has been greatly enhanced and Michael Schulz currently
cannot take care of it) but AROS Linux/i386 works quite fine. Nils
has committed a couple of patches which greatly enhance the speed of
the graphics output (it's now *much* faster then on the WoA in Cologne
last year in November). Right now, bugs in the build system and exec
are hunted by various AROS developers and I hope to see lots of progress
in that area when I return from my holidays.<P>

As for the survey which I started months ago, I hope I can summarize
them after the holidays :-)<P>

First of all, there are no news regarding the commercial venture
which I spoke about last time. Several ideas are currently weighted
against each other and, as usual when money comes into play, things
progress very slowly. In the mean time, AROS itself progresses at
its usual slow pace :-)<P>

As for job appliances, we need five people and only three persons
which we can use, applied, yet. So there are still two, high payed
jobs open.<P>

Currently, we use DOpus 4, kindly made available to the Amiga community
by GP Software, to find and fix bugs in AROS.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>5.4.2000</TD><TD>
More than two weeks since the last update. No, we're not dead :-) Work 
is still progressing; for example there is now a port of DOpus 4 (see our
<A HREF="http://www.aros.org/screenshots/">screenshots page</A>). Many things
still don't work but it has been ported in just a couple of hours of
work (mostly disabling things in DOpus that AROS doesn't support, yet).
Promising, I'd say.<P>

But the more important news is that we finally got the attention of Amiga
(mostly because of the efforts of Steve Crietzman of OAF and Gary Peake
of Amiga; thanks a lot guys). I'd like to say that's good news but that's
not completely clear, yet. The point is that Amiga would like to help us
but their lawyers object :-) Welcome to the wonderful world of business.
Currently, we're trying to find a way thought his legal mess which a)
doesn't hurt Amie, b) gives AROS room to breathe, c) makes Amigas lawyers
happy and d) helps the community. c) seems to be the most problematic
point here but we're working on it. Some very interesting ideas have been
proposed and now we and Amiga are checking what can be done and what is
futile. At this time, just a big thank at Amiga for their openmindedness
and the time they spent on this during the last three weeks when they
were also really busy with preparing everything for the Amiga 2K show.
Just in case you wonder why nothing was announced after fleecys' comment
in the IRC conference: The lawyers covered Bill with Red Tape when they
wanted to do the announcement. So you have to take my word for it :-)
Hopefully, you can read something in the Executive Summary, soon. No
promises, though; this is really ugly and every lawyer asked until now
strongly suggested to proceed with extreme care. Oh well...<P>

Something on the more positive front, whatever happenes, the AROS sources
will stay available at least under MPL. Also, 4 people already applied for
working on AROS. Unfortunately, only one of them can move to Switzerland
and that especially unfortunate as my boss has come up with some plans
to get this thing going. So please, if you can imagine working on this
full time, send your curriculum, etc. to
<A HREF="mailto:yourievsky@sowatec.com">yourievsky@sowatec.com</A>. As a
teaser: You will earn at least Sfr 72.000/year (that's about 45.000 Euros)
because otherwise, the Swiss Foreignpolice will not allow you to move
to Switzerland (basically, the idea is that if we don't need highly
trained specialists for that job, we should be able to find someone
native for that; good for you in this case). Additional bonus: If this
project fails, we can easily find something else for you to do. So no
matter what happens, you can rely on having a job :-)<P>

There is now a <A HREF="votes.html">summary of votes</A> on this
server which I will update once per day. Please continue voting.
Since there seems to be a confusion how the polling works: My
script looks for the questions and then for a digit and counts
that.
