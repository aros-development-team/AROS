      C Cross Referencing & Documenting tool. Version 1.4 - cxref-query
      =================================================================

A very simple program to query the cross-reference database that is created by
the cxref program. This is intended to be an example of the information that is
in the database and how to use it rather than a fully featured tool.

Usage: cxref-query [name [ ... name]]
                   [-Odirname]
                   [-Nbasename]
                   [-xref[-all][-file][-func][-var][-type]]

name            Names of objects to query.
                The names that it looks up are the names of:
                        Files
                        Variables
                        Functions
                        Typedefs

                If there are no names on the command line then the program
                enters interactive mode and prompts for names until an end of
                file (^D) is seen.

-Odirname       Use dirname as the input directory

-Nbasename      Use basename.* as the input filenames

-xref           Produce cross referencing information (see below).
                -all    All cross references.
                -file   Cross references for files.
                -func   Cross references for functions.
                -var    Cross references for variables.
                -type   Cross references for types.

The output depends on the -xref options but basically gives what is seen in the
section of the document for the named object.
