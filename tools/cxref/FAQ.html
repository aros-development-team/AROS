<h1>CXREF VERSION 1.5 - FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h1>

This file contains a list of frequently asked questions and their answers
relating to cxref version 1.5.

Not all of the questions here are real users questions, some of them have been
made up to give some help to people trying to use the program who find that the
README documentation is insufficient.

<h2><a name="Section-0">Section 0 - Why doesn't this FAQ answer my question?</a></h2>

This FAQ is released with each new version of the cxref program, so if the
question is one that is frequently asked about the new version then you will by
definition not find the answer here.

You can find the latest information about cxref at the cxref web-page, this
contains among other things a list of bug-fixes for the latest version.
<a href="http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/cxref/">http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/cxref/</a>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Section-1">Section 1 - What does cxref do (and what it doesn't)</a></h2>
<h3><a name="Q-1.1">Q 1.1   Does cxref support C++?</a></h3>
<pre>
No.

The cxref program only works for C, More specifically:

1) ANSI standard C with some leniency for common non-ANSI syntax.
        For example, the construct 'switch(foo) { case 1: ... default: }' is not
        ANSI, there must be a ';' after the default label, but it is accepted by
        cxref.

2) Traditional (K&amp;R) function declarations, with implicit 'int' and 'void'.
        For example 'foo(){}' is parsed as if 'int foo(void){}' was specified.

3) The ability to parse GCC extensions.
        The GCC '__attribute__' and '__extension__' keywords and most of the
        other GCC extensions. The 'inline' keyword is allowed.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-1.2">Q 1.2   Does cxref show which #includes that are not needed?</a></h3>
<pre>
No.

The output of the cxref program cross-references all of the functions,
variables, type definitions, included file etc.  There is not a way of
identifying files that are included in another source file that do not need to
be.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-1.3">Q 1.3   Can cxref document automatic function variables?</a></h3>
<pre>
No.

The inclusion of automatic variables in the output is not included.  This is
because of the number of them in a typical function.  In theory it could be made
to do this.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-1.4">Q 1.4   Does cxref run on systems other than UNIX?</a></h3>
<pre>
For example DOS / Win3 / Win95 / WinNT / OS/2.

UNIX    = Yes
        This is the system that the program way designed and initially written
        for, it should work on many versions of UNIX.
        I know that it works on Linux, SunOS 4.1.x, Solaris 2.x, AIX &amp; HP-UX 10.

DOS/Win3 = No
        The program was not designed for DOS, the filenames used and the
        multi-process nature of the program do not allow this.

Win95/WinNT = Yes
        Using the Cygwin library and tools <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/">http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/</a>
        it is possible to compile and run the programs.

OS/2    = Maybe
        I have reports that it is possible with OS/2 Warp with emx, but I do not
        support cxref for this OS.

<h2><a name="Section-2">Section 2 - When cxref does not work</a></h2>
<h3><a name="Q-2.1a">Q 2.1a  How do I find out what is causing the parse error?</a></h3>
<pre>
The following error message is generated by cxref when parsing a source file
(with YYDEBUG set to 0 in parse-yy.h when cxref was compiled).

test.c:   4: parse error, expecting `','' or `';''
^^^^^^  ^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
file    line            type of error
name    number        generated by yacc

The error is on line 4 of the file test.c.  In this case, the error message that
the yacc parser is generating is of some help, more often the error message is
just 'parse error'.

If YYDEBUG was set to 1 in parse-yy.h, then a more detailed error message would
be given (<a href="#Q-2.1b">See Q 2.1b</a>).
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-2.1b">Q 2.1b  What does this parse error message mean?</a></h3>
<pre>
The following error message is generated by cxref when parsing a source file
(with YYDEBUG set to 1 in parse-yy.h when cxref was compiled).

test.c:   4: parse error, expecting `','' or `';''

The previous 10, current and next 10 symbols are:
 -8 | 296 :              INT : int
 -7 | 258 :       IDENTIFIER : foo
 -6 |  40 :                  : (
 -5 | 292 :             VOID : void
 -4 |  41 :                  : )
 -3 | 123 :                  : {
 -2 | 296 :              INT : int
 -1 | 258 :       IDENTIFIER : a
  0 | 296 :              INT : int
  1 | 258 :       IDENTIFIER : b
  2 |  59 :                  : ;
  3 | 125 :                  : }
END OF FILE
^^^               ^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^
symbol              symbol    symbol
number               type     value

From this we can reconstruct part of the file test.c, using the previous and
next 10 symbol values from the lexer.

int foo(void) { int a   int b; }
                      ^
This is where the parse error occurred, after 'int a' and before 'int b;'.
The cause of the error is now clear, there is a ';' missing after the
declaration of the variable a.

The cxref program is intended to be used on source files that are known to
compile with a C compiler.  In this case a parse error message should not be
seen except for either non-standard C, (and compiler) or a bug in cxref.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-2.2">Q 2.2   Where are files doc/cxref.html &amp; FAQ.html referenced from README.html?</a></h3>
<pre>
The README.html file has a reference to the files doc/cxref.html and FAQ.html
these files are only present when 'make docs' has been run to generate the cross
references for the cxref program itself.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-2.3">Q 2.3   Why are half of the cross references missing?</a></h3>
<pre>
The way that cxref works is that it processes all of the source files for a
program, one at a time and generates a cross reference database.  A second pass
of the program is required to generate all of the cross references from the
database of cross reference information.

For this reason, the Makefile for the doc directory of cxref uses 'cxref *.c
-xref -Odoc' for the first pass and 'cxref *.c -xref -Odoc -html -latex' for the
second pass.  The first to build the database, the second to produce the
outputs.

The reason that the cross references are missing is that only one pass of the
program has been done on all of the files.  The later files to be be processed
will have cross references for the earlier files processed.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-2.4">Q 2.4   Why can't cxref process my header file in isolation?</a></h3>
<pre>
The cxref program needs to process the header files to enable a cross reference
for them to be generated.  In many cases, the header file will not have been
written with this in mind, and may rely on other header files being included
before the one being processed.  The best solution to this is to modify the
header file so that it includes all of the header files that it needs.

Another option is to use '-- -include filename.h' on the command line.  This
will include the specified file (filename.h) into the source file that is being
processed at the beginning.

There is a Perl script supplied with the cxref source files called fixheader.
This can be used to automatically determine what header files may be required.
The decision is based on the header files that are used for the files that cxref
can process and lots of test compilations.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-2.5">Q 2.5   Why can't LaTeX process the output files?</a></h3>
<pre>
There are two options for producing LaTeX output, '-latex' and '-latex2e'.
These refer to two different versions of the LaTeX program.  The first is for
use with LaTeX version 2.0.9, the second for use with LaTeX version 2e.

The file cxref.tex (or basename.tex if '-Nbasename' is used) is the file that
must be processed by LaTeX.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-2.6">Q 2.6   Why does the include file name have the complete path name?</a></h3>
<pre>
This is because a standard C preprocessor is being used instead of cxref-cpp or
an appropriate version of gcc.  One of the changes to the recent versions of gcc
(2.8.0) has been made to the GNU cccp to make cxref-cpp.  This is to make it
output the names of the include files as they are in the original source code
and not after the files have been translated into an absolute pathname.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-2.7">Q 2.7   Why does the include file name have the wrong path name?</a></h3>
<pre>
If the answer to this question is not the same as the answer to Q 2.6 then it
could be the following.  When the files that are being cross-referenced are in a
directory that contains a symbolic link in the path then the current directory
has two (or more) possible names.  The way that the cxref program works is that
it finds the current working directory (which is the real pathname, not using
any links).  If the name that you specify using -R is another name for the same
directory then cxref will not realise that they are the same.  This can cause
the pathnames to become confused.  Try using relative pathnames where possible
for the -R and -I options.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-2.8">Q 2.8   Why does cxref put in links to system include files?</a></h3>
<pre>
The way that cxref knows which include files are local to the program and which
ones are system ones is by the way that they are included.  Any that use double
quotes '"' are local ones and wil have links to them included in the cross
reference output.  The include files that use the angle brackets '&lt;&gt;' are system
files and do not have links to them included.

The best solution is to change the include files so that the distinction is
clear.  An alternative is to use the '-isystem DIRNAME' option of gcc.  This
will cause gcc to treat files in this directory as if they are system files.
Since cxref uses gcc for the pre-processing, this option can be passed through
using 'cxref file.c -- -isystem DIRNAME'.

<h2><a name="Section-3">Section 3 - How to make cxref do what you want</a></h2>
<h3><a name="Q-3.1">Q 3.1   How do I use cxref to process source files in more than one directory?</a></h3>
<pre>
The cxref program depends on a database of cross references, these must all be
consistent.  This requires that all of the files to be cross referenced are in
the same directory tree.

Example:

directory     files
- - - - -     - - -
basedir    :  f0.c f0.h ...
 |- s1     :  f1.c f1.h ...
 |- s2     :  f2.c f2.h ...
...

-- f2.c --
#include &lt;...&gt;
#include "f2.h"
#include "../s1/f1.h"
#include "f0.h"
----------

In the base directory 'basedir' run 'cxref -xref -Odoc s2/f2.c -html -I.'.  This
will create the file 'doc/s2/f2.c.html' for the file 'f2.c' and this will
contain references to the files 'doc/s2/f2.h.html', 'doc/s1/f1.h.html' and
'doc/f0.h.html'.  The subdirectories 'doc/s1', 'doc/s2' will be automatically
created within the 'doc' directory to put the files into (the 'doc' directory
must already exist).

directory        files
- - - - -        - - -
basedir
 |- doc       :  f0.c.html f0.h.html ... cxref.html
     |- s1    :  f1.c.html f1.h.html ...
     |- s2    :  f2.c.html f2.h.html ...
...

An alternative method is to use the -R option to cxref.  In the directory 's2',
cxref can be run as 'cxref -R.. -xref -Odoc f2.c -html -I.'.  This will change
directory to '..' ('basedir') before cxref is run, and will modify the cxref
arguments so that it is equivalent to running cxref from 'basedir' as detailed
above.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-3.2">Q 3.2   How can I add my own information to the output files?</a></h3>
<pre>
The files cxref.html and cxref.tex (depending on whether using HTML or LaTeX
format and the use of the '-Nbasename' option) are the ones to edit.  These
files contain the lines 'Begin-Of-Source-Files' and 'End-Of-Source-Files' as
comments.  The output files for each source file are automatically included
between these lines if they do not already exist there.  The order of these
files and any other text between these lines is not important.  Customisation of
the files should be added here.  The output files for each source file are
automatically generated so any edits made to these will be lost when cxref is
run.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-3.3">Q 3.3   Can I get a subset of the cross-reference information?</a></h3>
<pre>
At the moment, the only one way to limit the amount of cross referencing is to
use the '-xref-*' command line option (see README).  There are plans for a
future version of cxref to have an options file that would allow different
amounts of information to be generated in the output.  For example, only to
display called and not calls information for each function.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-3.4">Q 3.4   Is there an easy way to generate the comments in the correct format?</a></h3>
<pre>
The only easy way to do this is to use the cxref.el macro file and Emacs.  This
is what is used to generate the comments in the cxref source code itself.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-3.5">Q 3.5   How do I produce LaTeX output from a single source.c.tex output file?</a></h3>
<pre>
The file cxref.tex (or basename.tex if '-Nbasename' is used) is the file that
must be processed by LaTeX.  All of the individual LaTeX files for the source
files are included into this file.  If an individual file source.c.tex needs to
be processed then a copy of the file cxref.tex should be modified to include
only the required source.c.tex file.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-3.6">Q 3.6   How can I pass extra arguments to the C pre-processor?</a></h3>
<pre>
The cxref program itself has three ways that you can specify the arguments that
are passed to the C pre-processor.

a) The -CPP option allows the name of the pre-processor program itself to be
   changed.
   e.g. 'cxref -CPP "/usr/foo/cpp -C" foo.c' will use the cpp from /usr/foo
   instead of the compiled in default and pass it the option -C.

b) The most common C pre-processor commands are recognised by cxref
   automatically, these are -D*, -U* and -I*.

c) Any amount of extra options can be passed to the preprocessor by appending
   them to the command line after the end-of-arguments marker '--'.
   e.g. 'cxref foo.c -- -traditional' will pass -traditional to the
   pre-processor.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-3.7">Q 3.7   Can I cross-reference my source code at the same time as compiling it?</a></h3>
<pre>
It is possible to cross-reference and document your source code at the same time
as compiling it by using the cxref-cc script.  This takes the same arguments as
your usual C compiler and performs both functions.

First it calls the C compiler and passes on all of the command line arguments.
The real C compiler is specified by the CXREFCC environment variable, or the CC
environment variable or it will use gcc if neither of these are set.

Second the arguments that cxref needs to have are extracted from the arguments
that the C compiler had and cxref is called.  The arguments that are kept are
the -D*, -U*, -I* arguments to specify #defines and #include paths, and the file
name of the source file itself.  Any other arguments are taken from the .cxref
file (<a href="#Q-3.8">See Q 3.8</a>).

After doing this it will still be necessary to sort out the header files since
these are not cross-referenced using this method.
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-3.8">Q 3.8   What use is the .cxref configuration file?</a></h3>
<pre>
The most obvious use is if you have a lot of command line options that you don't
want to have to enter every time that you run the program.

However the .cxref file is most useful when you have a multiple directory source
tree (See&lt; Q 3.1), or when you are using an existing Makefile to build
documentation.

When there are various subdirectories containing source code, a .cxref file in
each sub-directory can be used just containing the line '-R..' or whatever is
appropriate to point cxref to the root of the source tree.  This means that
there is no need to keep track of which directory you are in, they all will use
the correct directory to work from.

If you already have a Makefile that goes through all of the source code then you
may want to modify it so that it calls cxref instead of calling the C compiler.
This means that there is no room to put the extra arguments to cxref on the
command line.  A .cxref file can contain the command line arguments so that you
only need to need the arguments that are already there for the C compiler
(<a href="#Q-3.7">See Q 3.7</a>).
</pre>

<h2><a name="Section-4">Section 4 - More information about cxref</a></h2>
<h3><a name="Q-4.1">Q 4.1   Who wrote cxref, When and Why?</a></h3>
<pre>
The cxref program was written by Andrew M. Bishop (amb@gedanken.demon.co.uk) in
1995,96,97,98,99 and maintained since then.

There is a cxref home-page on the World Wide Web, available via the author's
home-page at <a href="http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/">http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/</a> .  This is kept updated with news
about the program, as new versions become available.

An earlier program by the same author using basically the same comment
convention was written in Emacs Lisp in 1994.  This version was slow, the amount
of cross referencing was poor and the output was only in troff format.  The
current C program was written to replace this but has grown to become much
better in the cross referencing that is done and the format of the output has
increased greatly.

The cxref program can be freely distributed according to the terms of the GNU
General Public License (see the file `COPYING').
</pre>
<h3><a name="Q-4.2">Q 4.2   How do I report bugs in cxref?</a></h3>
<pre>
By e-mail, send them to me at amb@gedanken.demon.co.uk and put cxref somewhere
in the subject line.  You can also report bugs or provide comments via the
feedback form on the cxref home-page on the World Wide Web accessible via
<a href="http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/">http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/</a> .

Before doing this, you should check the FAQ and the cxref web-page to see if the
answer is there.  If it is not, and it is a parse error then check that it is a
cxref problem and not a syntax error in the source file.
When you are sure that it is a cxref bug, give me as much information as you
can, about the error, when it happens, what system you are using etc.  It is
useful if you can provide a small example and the output of using the '-raw'
option to provide the actual output that you are seeing.  (If it is an HTML or
LaTeX specific problem then send that file instead.)
