             C Cross Referencing & Documentation tool Version 1.5d
             =====================================================

To install the program, do the following:

1) Run ./configure

   The cxref specific options that you can use are:

   --enable-us-paper    - Enable US paper size instead of A4
   --with-cxref-cpp     - This forces the cxref-cpp program to be compiled and
                          used instead of gcc.

   The list of generic configure options can be seen by using the --help option.


2) Run 'make'         in this directory to make all of the programs
       'make docs'    in this directory to make the README & documents
       'make install' in this directory to install the program.

       To install the files with a different root directory you can use
       'make install DESTDIR=/some/directory/'.


3) Print README.ps, read README.dvi or browse README.html to understand how to
   use the program.
