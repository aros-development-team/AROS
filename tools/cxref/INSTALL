             C Cross Referencing & Documentation tool Version 1.5g
             =====================================================

To install the program, do the following:

1) Run ./configure

   The cxref specific options that you can use are:

   --enable-us-paper    - Enable US paper size instead of A4

   --with-cxref-cpp     - This forces the cxref-cpp program to be compiled and
                          used instead of gcc.
   --without-cxref-cpp  - This forces the cxref-cpp program not to be compiled
                          and gcc will be used instead.

   (Normally the configure script will check if the gcc version that you are
    using works the same as cxref-cpp and uses that if it is.  The above two
    options allow forcing to either use cxref-cpp or gcc in all cases).

   The list of generic configure options can be seen by using the --help option.

   The most useful one is --prefix which allows the installation directory to
   be specified.  For example './configure --prefix=/usr/local' will install all
   of the files under 'bin' and 'man/man*' subdirectories of '/usr/local'.


2) Run 'make'         in this directory to make all of the programs
       'make docs'    in this directory to make the README & documents
       'make install' in this directory to install the program.

       To install the files with a different root directory you can use
       'make install DESTDIR=/some/directory/'.  This will prefix all of
       the installation directories with '/some/directory/'.


3) Print README.ps, read README.dvi or browse README.html to understand how to
   use the program.
