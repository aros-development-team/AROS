     C Cross Referencing & Documenting tool. Version 1.4 - documentation
     ===================================================================

The files fonts.sty, page.sty and cxref.sty are needed for cxref.tex to be
LaTeXed.  They are included in the executable program cxref and output as files
into the output directory.  These files are derived from the fonts.style,
page.style and cxref.style files in this directory.

fonts.style  Is a modified copy of 10pt.sty from the standard LaTeX distribution.

page.style   Gives narrower margins than the standard LaTeX a4.sty.

cxref.style  Contains all of the new environments that are used in typesetting
             the cxref output.
