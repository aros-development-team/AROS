Version 1.0 of cxref released : Sat Feb 24 16:30:00 1996
--------------------------------------------------------

A program that can automatically generate documentation and cross references for
a C program.

The input is any C program with appropriate comments and the output is LaTeX or
HTML files.

The documentation for the program is produced from comments in the code that are
appropriately formatted.  The cross referencing comes from the code itself and
requires no extra work.
