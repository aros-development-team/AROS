Documentation for ArchTool
--------------------------

The name ArchTool comes from "archive".
Archives are no longer used in AROS, so this part has been removed from
archtool.

[Note: All names are case-sensitive.]


Integrated programs
-------------------

Usage: archtool [-h|-t|-c|-R] <parameter>

  -h help

  -t genfunctable
     Usage: archtool -t <archfile>
     for HIDDs with 'type hidd' in lib.conf: archtool -t
  -c genlibdefs
     Usage: archtool -c [-o libdefs.h] [lib.conf]
  -R genarossource
     Usage: archtool -R  <source pragma file> <source c file> <dest c file> <output defines file>

 1) Generate functable.c
This module generates functable.c in the current dir from the <archfile>
archive. It reads in lib.conf and if type==hidd archfile is not needed.
[Note: By now no(!) aliases for function names are allowed! However,
 aliases are only used in rom/dos. Therefore this lib can't be converted
 by now.]

 2) Generate libdefs.h
This module generates "libdefs.h" file out of "lib.conf" file.
The name of the output include file can be given with the -o switch.
Any other argument is taken as the name of the config file.
By default a libdefs.h file will be generated and the config file is
lib.conf.
