# This is an example MetaMake file

# This are lines which MetaMake will examine. The rest of the file is
# ignored. The '-' means that Demo is a virtual target (ie. one which
# doesn't exist in the makefile and for which MetaMake mustn't call
# the maketool). The '\' at the end of the line means that this rule
# is continued on the next line which must start with #MM.
#MM- Demo : all \
#MM	    print

# This is a short-cut: MetaMake will read the next line and use the
# target there as the name of a MetaTarget. Note that all depends on
# real-target which MetaMake will ignore; even if real-target exists
# as a MetaTarget, it won't be considered when MetaMake wants to build
# "all" in this directory.
#MM
all : real-target

# MetaMake will print a warning for the non-existing-target.
#MM print : non-existing-target
print :
	echo Done.

# This is a real target which MetaMake ignores.
real-target :
	echo Real target.
