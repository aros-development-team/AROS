Convert FD files to gcc 'inlines'
.description
FD2InLine is useful if you want to use GCC for Amiga-specific
development and would like to call the functions in the Amiga shared
libraries efficiently.  The format of calls to the Amiga shared
library functions differs substantially from the default function call
format of C compilers.  Therefore, some tricks are necessary if you
want to use these functions.

FD2InLine is a parser that converts FD files and clib files to GCC
inlines.  FD and clib files contain information about functions in
shared libraries.  FD2InLine reads these two files and merges the
information contained therein, producing an output file suitable for
use with the GCC compiler.  This output file contains so-called
inlines, one for each function entry.  Using them, GCC can produce
very efficient code for making function calls to Amiga shared
libraries.
