Place your include files here.

The directories are processed in alphabetical order.

The AmigaOS includes goes to the "amigaos" directory. You can add your
own in the "3rd" directory and the content of
"morphosdev/emulinclude/includenew" from the MorhpOS SDK in
"morphos". Since existing files are overwritten, the MorphOS files will
replace files also found in "amigaos".

Don't forget to add the FD files in ".../os-lib/fd/XXX" as well.
