Place your FD files here.

The directories are processed in alphabetical order.

The AmigaOS FDs goes to the "amigaos" directory. You can add your own in
the "3rd" directory and the content of
"morphosdev/emulinclude/includenew/fd" from the MorhpOS SDK in
"morphos". Since existing files are overwritten, the MorphOS files will
replace files also found in "amigaos".

Don't forget to add the include files in ".../os-include/XXX" as
well.
