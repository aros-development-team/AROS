FlexCat/ - Catalog maker

MetaMake/ - The main building tool. MetaMake allows to specify targets
	in different makefiles which will be done at the same time.
	MetaMake will search by itself for all Makefiles, collect all
	metatargets and build them just as make would do with a single
	big makefile.

archtools/ - Utility to build a library or something similar form a set
	of files which contain functions.

buildshared/ - This should become the main build tool for shared libraries,
	devices, HIDDs, etc.

commonlib/ - All functions which are often used (e.g. strlen()) are put
	here. Other libraries which offer these functions should use the
	code in here.

cpak/ - The first version of archtool.

crypt.c - This is a small program which allows you to create a password if
	you want to use the CVS server (prefered). See the section about
	\lref{CVS}{CVS} for how it works.

genmf/ - Helper to create MetaMakefiles by filling in templates.

hpp/ - Very simple tool to preprocess HTML files.

toollib/ - Functions used by several tools in this directory.
