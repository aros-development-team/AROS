<h1>Readme file for ADFLib on Win32</h1>
<p>
<p>This file contains additional information on using ADFLib under 32-bit Windows. 
  See the main library documentation for more general info.
<h2>Compiling the library on Win32 platforms</h2>
<p>The ADFLib distribution contains a two makefiles for nmake:
<p><b>Win32Lib.mak</b><br>
  Compiles the ADFLib as a static library. To use it, simply link your program 
  with adflib.lib and #include adflibusr.h.
<p><b>Win32DLL.mak</b><br>
  Compiles ADFLib as a DLL. This will produce the files ADFLib.dll, ADFLib.lib 
  (the import library to link with your
<p>Both makefiles contain debug and release targets. To specify which one to use, 
  use a command line like this:
<pre>NMAKE /f "ADFLib.mak" CFG="ADFLib - Win32 Release"</pre>
<p>The makefiles will produce a debug version of the library by default if no 
  configuration is specified.
<h2>The Win32 native functions</h2>
<p>When ADFLib is compiled under Win32, the Win32 native functions will be linked, 
  allowing you to access Amiga harddisks directly in Windows. Current only Windows 
  NT is supported - support for Windows 95 and 98 is in the pipeline.
<p>For the direct drive access routines to work under Windows NT, you need administrative 
  priviledges. This is a security feature of Windows NT and there is no way around 
  it.
<p>To open a physical device, simply use the following format as the filname: 
<pre>|Hx</pre>
<p>Where x is the ID of the drive to mount. Example: 
<pre>hd = adfMountDev(&quot;|H1&quot;);</pre>
<p>Your system boot device always has an ID of 0. Attempting to mount it is not 
  a good idea!
