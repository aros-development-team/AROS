 TODO

  * add SAS/C support. I mainly mean using SAS messager. Would be handy a lot.

  * add trailing elipses check (...) in #?.cd and #?.ct (as CatComp does)

    WARNING: original string for token '%s' had a trailing ellipsis (...)
             file '%s' line %lu

  * seems FlexCat read "\n\Polska wersja" but wrote "\npolska wersja"?

    I already reported a problem with reading large (e.g. bit 31 set, also
    locale prototype says ULONG is accepted) string_ids with FlexCat
    earlier today (not translated).  As FlexCat reports identical ids for
    every such large number I guess it uses atol() and gets 0 :-(

    I thought I could work around the bug by using hexadecimal numbers
    introduced by $ as mentioned in CatComp.doc.  However it turns out
    that FlexCat does not recognize $, only 0x is recognized since 1.9:
    franc,ais.cd, Zeile 11; Warnung: Erwartete MinLen (Zeichen '/').
    I recommend parsing $ for compatibility with CatComp.

    In the end I'd like to make a suggestion to improve
    FlexCat tool. After updating an old .ct file by a new
    one (which is great function itself) would be handy
    to have even changed strings marked (just like these
    newly added).

  * sprawdziê czy gmtime() przy $TODAY nie robi jakiô bzdur z czasem.

  * zaktualizowaê listë tîumaczy w dokumentacji

  * check $TODAY handling (is there any bug?)

  * CTINFO - generuje w #?.ct informacje   ; ID: %ld   MIN: %ld  MAX: %ld
             lub w formie graficznej:

    ID_XXX

Hi!

Here are some suggestions/bugs in flexcat 1.9

SUGG:  User defineable way to describe non-ascii chars like CR LF BEEP
       NULL etc. to make flexcat more programming-language
       independent. (e.g. '0A'x in Arexx) [yeah, I'm mad enough to
       localise my ARexx scripts ;-) ]

NICE:  I wrote a little script file to create catalogs/sources more
       easyly. Add it or delete it :)))

        The offset is -1.
