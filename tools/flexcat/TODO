used %: bvlnidxc
mine %: a - string id in byte form 
        t - string len (long aligned) in byte form - move both to %n[xdo]!
        z - fill with zeros up to length t

 TODO
 ----

1. Add SAS/C support. I mainly mean using SAS messager. Would be handy a lot.

--> Do we really want to keep support for SAS/C?


2. Add trailing elipses check (...) in #?.cd and #?.ct (as CatComp does)

    WARNING: original string for token '%s' had a trailing ellipsis (...)
             file '%s' line %lu

--> Definitely.


3. Seems FlexCat read "\n\Polska wersja" but wrote "\npolska wersja"?

--> To be investigated.

    I already reported a problem with reading large (e.g. bit 31 set, also
    locale prototype says ULONG is accepted) string_ids with FlexCat
    earlier today (not translated).  As FlexCat reports identical ids for
    every such large number I guess it uses atol() and gets 0 :-(

    I thought I could work around the bug by using hexadecimal numbers
    introduced by $ as mentioned in CatComp.doc.  However it turns out
    that FlexCat does not recognize $, only 0x is recognized since 1.9:
    franc,ais.cd, Zeile 11; Warnung: Erwartete MinLen (Zeichen '/').
    I recommend parsing $ for compatibility with CatComp.

5.  * From	"Vit Sindlar" <sindlarv@hotmail.com>

    In the end I'd like to make a suggestion to improve
    FlexCat tool. After updating an old .ct file by a new
    one (which is great function itself) would be handy
    to have even changed strings marked (just like these
    newly added).

--> Would be handy to have...


6.  Update the list of translators in the documentation.

--> To be done for 2.7.


7.  * CTINFO - generates the following in #?.ct files - ID: %ld   MIN: %ld  MAX: %ld
    or graphically:

    ID_XXX

    ;    |      |
    ;   MIN    MAX

--> Hm, what for?

    Hi!

    Here are some suggestions/bugs in flexcat 1.9

    SUGG:  User defineable way to describe non-ascii chars like CR LF BEEP
           NULL etc. to make flexcat more programming-language
           independent. (e.g. '0A'x in Arexx) [yeah, I'm mad enough to
           localise my ARexx scripts ;-) ]

    NICE:  I wrote a little script file to create catalogs/sources more
           easyly. Add it or delete it :)))

--> To be considered for a future release...

   The offset is -1.

   DMX says: Replacing gmtime() with localtime() fixed it, hopefully :)
