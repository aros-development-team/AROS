Description: GRand Unified Bootloader
 GRUB is a GPLed bootloader intended to unify bootloading across x86
 operating systems.  In addition to loading the Linux and *BSD kernels,
 it implements the Multiboot standard, which allows for flexible loading
 of multiple boot images (needed for modular kernels such as the GNU
 Hurd).
