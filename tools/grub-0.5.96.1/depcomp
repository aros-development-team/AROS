## There are various ways to get dependency output from gcc.  Here's
## why we pick this rather obscure method:
## - Don't want to use -MD because we'd like the dependencies to end
##   up in a subdir.  Having to rename by hand is ugly.
##   (We might end up doing this anyway to support other compilers.)
## - The DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT environment variable makes gcc act like
##   -MM, not -M (despite what the docs say).
## - Using -M directly means running the compiler twice (even worse
##   than renaming).

## This next piece of magic avoids the `deleted header file' problem.
## The problem is that when a header file which appears in a .P file
## is deleted, the dependency causes make to die (because there is
## typically no way to rebuild the header).  We avoid this by adding
## dummy dependencies for each header file.  Too bad gcc doesn't do
## this for us directly.
