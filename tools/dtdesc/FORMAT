Fileformat of a dtd-file

createdtdesc uses an ASCII-file to obtain the description
for a DataType-descriptor.
examinedtdesc creates one out of a DataType-descriptor.
These ASCII-files are the DataTypeDescriptions (*.dtd) .
*.dtd files consist of Keyword=Data pairs in separate lines.
Lines starting with a '#' or empty lines are ignored.
In fact, my parser is so dumb, that it ignores anything
but the keywords. But this may change in future!
Currently you can feed this file FORMAT to createdtdesc and
it will produce a valid DataType descriptor.
Comments in lines are not allowed, even when they start with a '#'!
The Keyword must be followed immediatly by a '=' .
The whole rest of a line after the '=' is handled as the Data-part.
So be carefull with whitespace.
Keywords are case-sensitive.
Currently the following 9 Keywords are defined:

1)  Name        Name of the DataType. Used in the NAME-chunk and
                as the dth_Name component in the struct DataTypeHeader
                in the DTHD-chunk. The name is also used for default icons
                (def_Name.info).

2)  Version     A standard Amiga-version-string. Used in the FVER-chunk.
                This Keyword is optional. When it is missing no FVER-chunk
                is written. Hint: use 4 digit years to avoid wrong interpretation.

3)  BaseName    BaseName of the DataType as it resides in
                Sys:Classes/DataTypes . No ".datatype" must be appended.

4)  Pattern     FileNamePattern, an standard Amiga-pattern.
                I suggest not to use FileNamePatterns to recognice
                a filetype. Please use the fit-all-pattern "#?" .
                createdtdesc does this too, if Pattern is ommited.

5)  Mask        Comparison mask to identify a file by its constant parts.
                To be specified as white space separated list of any
                of the following items:
                
                - specific char (ASCII)     : 'A' 'B' '1' '2'
                
                - specific char (numeric)   : 10 100 12 0xd8 
                
                - wildcard matching any char: ANY
                
6)  GroupID     GroupID of the DataTypes group. This ID must comply to the rules.
                createdtdesc doesn't check the validity. See <datatypes/datatypes.h>
                for details.

                syst : System file, such as; directory, executable, library, device, font, etc.
                text : Formatted or unformatted text
                docu : Formatted text with graphics or other DataTypes
                soun : Sound
                inst : Musical instruments used for musical scores
                musi : Musical score
                pict : Still picture
                anim : Animated picture
                movi : Animation with audio track

7)  ID          The ID of this DataType. This ID must complain to the rules.
                createdtdesc doesn't check the validity. See <datatypes/datatypes.h>
                for details.

                For IFF types it is the Form type, for other files it's the first
                four characters of the name of the file type.

8)  Flags       Flags as defined in <datatypes/datatypes.h> The following
                flags are supported:

                DTF_BINARY
                DTF_ASCII
                DTF_IFF
                DTF_MISC
                DTF_CASE         (AROS uses this for comparing the Mask)
                DTF_SYSTEM1

                Multiple flags must be separated by ',' without spaces between.

9)  Priority    In most cases priority is 0. When this Keyword
                is missing 0 is assumed.
