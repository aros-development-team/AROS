Fileformat of a dtd-file

createdtdesc uses an ASCII-file to obtain the description
for an DataType-descriptor.
examinedtdesc creates one out of a DataType-descriptor.
These ASCII-files are the DataTypeDescriptions (*.dtd) .
*.dtd files consist of Keyword=Data pairs in separate lines.
Lines starting with a '#' or empty lines are ignored.
In fact, my parser is so dump, that it ignores anything
but the keywords. But this may change in future!
Currently you can feed this file FORMAT to createdtdesc and
it will produce a valid DataType descriptor.
Comments in lines are not allowed, even when they start with a '#'!
The Keyword must be followed immediatly by a '=' .
The whole rest of a line after the '=' is handled as the Data-part.
So be carefull with whitespace.
Keywords are case-sensitive.
Currently the following 9 Keywords are defined:

1)  Name        Name of the DataType. Used in the NAME-chunk and
		as the dth_Name component in the struct DataTypeHeader
		in the DTHD-chunk. The name is also used for default icons
		(def_Name.info).

2)  Version     A standard Amiga-version-string. Used in the FVER-chunk.
		This Keyword is optional. When it is missing no FVER-chunk
		is written. Hint: use 4 digit years to avoid wrong interpretation.

3)  BaseName    BaseName of the DataType as it resides in
		Sys:Classes/DataTypes . No ".datatype" must be appended.

4)  Pattern     FileNamePattern, an standard Amiga-pattern.
		I suggest not to use FileNamePatterns to recognice
		a filetype. Please use the fit-all-pattern "#?" .
		createdtdesc does this too, if Pattern is ommited.

5)  Mask        Comparision mask to identify a file by its constant parts.
		To be specified as white space separated list of any
		of the following items:
		
		- specific char (ASCII)     : 'A' 'B' '1' '2'
		
		- specific char (numeric)   : 10 100 12 0xd8 
		
		- wildcard matching any char: ANY
		
6)  GroupID     GroupID of the DataTypes group. This ID must complain to the rules.
		createdtdesc doesn't check the validity. See <datatypes/datatypes.h>
		for details.

		syst : System file, such as; directory, executable, library, device, font, etc.
		text : Formatted or unformatted text
		docu : Formatted text with graphics or other DataTypes
		soun : Sound
		inst : Musical instruments used for musical scores
		musi : Musical score
		pict : Still picture
		anim : Animated picture
		movi : Animation with audio track

7)  ID          ID The ID of this DataType. This ID must complain to the rules.
		createdtdesc doesn't check the validity. See <datatypes/datatypes.h>
		for details.

		For IFF types it is the Form type, for other files it's the first
		four characters of the name of the file type.

8)  Flags       Flags as defined in <datatypes/datatypes.h> The following
		flags are supported:

		DTF_BINARY
		DTF_ASCII
		DTF_IFF
		DTF_MISC
		DTF_CASE         (AROS uses this for comparing the Mask)
		DTF_SYSTEM1

		Multiple flags must be separated by ',' without spaces between.

9)  Priority    Priority In most cases priority is 0. When this Keyword
		is missing 0 is assumed.

# This is a comment.
# The following blank line is ignored, too.

# Name - name of the DataType
# Used in the NAME-chunk and
# in DataTypeHeader->dth_Name .
Name=ILBM

# Version - Amiga-version-string
# Used in a FVER-chunk.
# This is optional.
Version=$VER: ILBM 44.5 (03-Nov-2000)

# BaseName - name of the DataType-class
# Used in DataTypeHeader->dth_BaseName .
BaseName=ilbm

# Pattern - filenamepattern
# Hey, this is not MSDOS, you shouldn't use filenamepatterns.
# When this is missing '#?' is assumed.
# Used in DataTypeHeader->dth_Pattern .
Pattern=#?

# Mask - the recognition-mask
# Used in DataTypeHeader->dth_Mask .
# DataTypeHeader->dth_MaskLen is counted from this string.
Mask='F' 'O' 'R' 'M' ANY ANY ANY ANY 'I' 'L' 'B' 'M'

# GroupID - GroupID as descriped in <datatypes/datatypes.h>
# Used in DataTypeHeader->dth_GroupID .
GroupID=pict

# ID - ID of the DataType
# Used in DataTypeHeader->dth_ID .
ID=ilbm

# Flags - flags as descriped in <datatypes/datatypes.h>
# Used in DataTypeHeader->dth_Flags .
Flags=DTF_IFF,DTF_CASE

# Priority - priority of the Datatype
# In most cases this is 0.
# When this is missing 0 is assumed.
# Used in DataTypeHeader->dth_Priority .
Priority=0
