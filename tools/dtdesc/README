dtdesc - The DataType Descriptor Tools

Here you have two tools to create and disassemble DataType descriptors.
DataType descriptors are those little files in Devs:DataTypes/ , which
are used by the DataType system to recognice the type of a file.
DataType descriptors are IFF-FORMs of type DTYP.
They contain different chunks. The most important are:

NAME : Name of the DataType, in most cases identical to the filename

FVER : Amiga-version-string (optional)

DTHD : DataTypeHeader The most important chunk.
       Contains a struct DataTypeHeader as descriped in <datatypes/datatypes.h>
       and the strings for this struct.

DTCD : Code-chunk This chunk contains executable code. So you can have
       a function to decide the type of a file.
       Because this is not portable to AROS, it is not supported by dtdesc.

For more informations see the header <datatypes/datatypes.h> .

examinedtdesc is used to disassemble an existing DataType descriptor.
It accepts as its only argument the filename of a DataType descriptor.
It outputs a DataType description suitable for createdtdesc (see below)
to stdout. This DataType description is an ASCII-file, for details see
the file FORMAT .

createdtdesc is a tool to create a DataType descriptor.
It has one required argument: the filename of a DataType description (*.dtd file).
Optional with the "-o" switch you can define the Name of the output
DataType descriptor.
When no output-name is given, the name for the Datatype descriptor is taken
from the "Name" keyword from the Datatype description. The resulting
Datatype descriptor is placed in the current directory.

Yes I know my naming convention is a bit confusing, come with better names!
