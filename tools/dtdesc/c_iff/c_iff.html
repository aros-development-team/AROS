<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
c_iff is a portable IFF parser library written entirely in simple C.
With this library you can read and write IFFs in an easy way.
It is inspired by the Amigas own iffparse.library, but without its
esotheric behaviour.

<a name="Background"></a>
<h2>
Background
</h2>
IFF - Interchange File Format is the Amigas way to store data in a
generic form. An IFF can contain nearly every type of data you can
imagine, e.g. pictures (ILBM), animations (ANIM), sounds (AIFF),
text (FTXT) or all of this in one file. This file can also contain
Meta-information like the authors name or a version-strings.
In the PC-world the name IFF is wrongly attached to the IFF-subtype
ILBM, a picture-format.

<a name="Portability"></a>
<h2>
Portability
</h2>
c_iff is written in clean ANSI-C. It uses only simple functions
from &lt;stdlib.h&gt; and &lt;stdio.h&gt; .
So it should be portable to anything, a C-compiler exists for.
I have tested it on the following machines:

<ul>
 <li>
  AmigaOS native m68k with different compilers
 </li>
 <li>
  AmigaOS PowerUp PPC with the vbccppc compiler
 </li>
 <li>
  Linux APUS PPC with the gcc compiler
 </li>
 <li>
  Linux SuSE AMD K6 with the gcc compiler
 </li>
</ul>

You see, it runs on Big and Little Endian machines.
IFFs are stored in Big Endian order. To write portable code you must
swap the bytes of multibyte numbers before you write them to an IFF
or after you read them from an IFF. c_iff provides the two macros
Swap16IfLE and Swap32IfLE to do this.
If you are on a Big Endian machine you might have to add your machine to c_iff.h
64-bit machines (and 16-bit machines) are now supported too.
Never use your machines (unsigned) char, short, int, long numbers if you deal
with IFFs. Instead use the CARDXX and INTXX definitions from c_iff.h .

<a name="Installation"></a>
<h2>
Installation
</h2>
There is no configure and such things, just a simple Makefile.
This should be usable for any unixoid system, that has cc, ar and ranlib.
Just type "make" to build the statical library libc_iff.a .
To build the documentation, type "make doc". This requieres perl installed.
"make example" builds the example.

<a name="Documentation"></a>
<h2>
Documentation
</h2>
c_iff has a build in documentation. This is generated by a "make doc" .
This produces a file <a href="c_iff.txt">c_iff.txt</a> . This file
is in Amigas AutoDoc format, a simple ASCII-format.
The file <a href="example.c">example.c</a> shows how to use c_iff to read and write
IFFs. The binary is build by "make example" .

<h2>
Limitations
</h2>
c_iff currently only supports FORM IFFs. But the other types of IFFs are very rare.
If you need them, tell me.
