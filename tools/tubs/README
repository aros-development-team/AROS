TUBS - The Ultimate Build System

TUBS is intended to provide a new way to exploit the GNU Make capabilities to 
implement a new build system which is fast, flexible and easy to mantain.

Future implementations might not use GNU Make anymore, though, but
compatibility with the "tubsfiles" will most likely be retained.

There's no description of what the system can do and how it can do it as for
now, I'm just providing here the system's core "Tubsengine" and a sample
"tubsfile", both used to build the AWeb (http://aweb.sunsite.dk/) executable.

Have a look around, ask questions if you so wish, and wait for me to get more
time on my hands to write proper documentation and complete the system ;)
