0.1 (20.3.2001)
First version. Features IFF-PREF import/export and a font sensitive gadtools GUI.

(Internal release)

0.2 (24.3.2001)
ReadArgs() support with Release 2 template. Structural changes to  handleiff.c.

(Internal release)

0.3 (3.4.2001)
Font knows how to deal with gadtools menus.

(Developer's release)

0.4 (5.4.2001)
Font now stores its data in big endian format to remain AmigaOS compatibly. Additionally, the "PRHD"
IFF "Preferences Header" chunk is shrunk by two bytes for compatibility reasons.

Fixed a couple of minor bugs.

(Internal release)

0.5 (5.4.2001)
Two more menu options have been added ("Open" and "Save As").

IFF parsing slightly altered.

Project file "getfile.c" removed - code moved to new file "asl.c"

(Developer's release 2)

0.6 (9.4.2001)
The "Edit" menu has been added with its three items. The items have been assigned the proper code.
"init.c" has been cleaned up resulting in a new	function - "initDefaultPrefs()".

(Internal release)

0.7 (19.4.2001)
The "code flow" of "Font" Preferences has been dramatically changed in order to pave way for a more
polished source code. The internal API has changed; we are not backwards compatible with earlier
versions! Gadtools GUI has been totally reworked - most parts rewritten.

(Developer's release 3)

0.8 (28.4.2001)
A bug somewhere in "Font" 0.7 caused AROS to crash. The erroneous code was isolated in
getArguments() and fixed. (Developer's release 4)

0.9 (21.9.2001)
"Font" is now localized. A Swedish ("svenska") catalog translation file has been added.

(Internal release)

0.10 (27.9.2001)
More (all?) strings have been added to the catalog description file.

"Font" now preforms some basic sanity checks on the preferences input.

The library management routines have been changed with inspiration from "Locale" Preferences.

The window now sports a zoom gadgets which called for IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW support.

A while ago, a missing memory allocation was found by Georg Steger. Although he commited a
fix, new code has been added replacing his (Font should require slightly less stackmemory
now)

(Developer's release 5)

0.11 (30.9.2001)
"Font" now listens for IDCMP_VANILLAKEY events, currently only responding to "code 27" - triggered
by the "escape" key.

(Developer's release 6)

0.12 (25.10.2001)
Some debug code has been removed. The remaining debug messages are now printed using kprintf()
rather than printf().

The source code has been polish for a better "AROS Development Code Compliancy".

(Internal release)

0.13 (8.1.2002)
Georg Steger's "registertab" code has been incorporated to the "Font" source tree. The GUI layout
process has undergone some slight changes to take the "registertab" into account.

Apart from showing fontnames, the textgadget now also shows the fontsize.

"Font" now checks the version number of catalogs - note that obolete catalogs will no longer
work with "Font"! The current supported catalog is currently "fontprefs.catalog" 2.

(Internal release)

0.14 (14.1.2002)
The code for the preview page has been additionally enhanced. The source code has proven to be
stable enough to be considered taken out of "alpha" release. Some work still remains, though.
As part of process, the code is currently being polished; the inputloop has been taken out of
"gui.c" and put into a new source file - "inputloop.c".

A lot of functions now sports all new prototypes.

Quite a few compiler warnings have been fixed.

Locale support has been further extended.

The IFF parsing should contains some for conditional checking, which should make "Font" run
safer in case the system is put under a lot of stress.

"Font" opens its window at the position of the mousepointer.

The font requester now defaults the current choice to whatever the user has previously
chosen.

As this release is scheduled for CVS commitment, any old catalog translation (apart from
"svenska") won't work any longer and needs to be rebuilt (also see version notes above for
"Font" 0.13)!

(Developer's release 7)
