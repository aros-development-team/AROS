0.1 (20.3.2001)		First version. Features IFF-PREF import/export and a font sensitive
			gadtools GUI. (Internal release)
0.2 (24.3.2001)		ReadArgs() support with Release 2 template. Structural changes to 
			handleiff.c. (Internal release)
0.3 (3.4.2001)		Font knows how to deal with gadtools menus. (Developer's release)
0.4 (5.4.2001)		Font now stores its data in big endian format to remain AmigaOS compatibly.
			Additionally, the "PRHD" IFF "Preferences Header" chunk is shrunk by two
			bytes for compatibility reasons. Fixed a couple of minor bugs. (Internal 
			release)
0.5 (5.4.2001)		Two more menu options have been added ("Open" and "Save As"). IFF parsing
			slightly altered. Project file "getfile.c" removed - code moved to new file
			"asl.c" (Developer's release 2)
0.6 (9.4.2001)		The "Edit" menu has been added with its three items. The items have been
			assigned the proper code. "init.c" has been cleaned up resulting in a new
			function - "initDefaultPrefs()". (Internal release)
0.7 (19.4.2001)		The "code flow" of "Font" Preferences has been dramatically changed in order
			to pave way for a more polished source code. The internal API has changed;
			we are not backwards compatible with earlier versions! Gadtools GUI has been
			totally reworked - most parts rewritten. (Developer's release 3)
0.8 (28.4.2001)		A bug somewhere in "Font" 0.7 caused AROS to crash. The erroneous code was
			isolated in getArguments() and fixed. (Developer's release 4)
0.9 (21.9.2001)		"Font" is now localized. A Swedish ("svenska") catalog translation file has
			been added. (Internal release)
0.10 (27.9.2001)	More (all?) strings have been added to the catalog description file. "Font"
			now preforms some basic sanity checks on the preferences input. The
			library management routines have been changed with inspiration from
			"Locale" Preferences. The window now sports a zoom gadgets which called
			for IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW support. A while ago, a missing memory allocation was
			found by Georg Steger. Although he commited a fix, new code has been added
			replacing his (Font should require slightly less stackmemory now)
			(Developer's release 5)
0.11 (30.9.2001)	"Font" now listens for IDCMP_VANILLAKEY events, currently only responding
			to "code 27" - triggered by the "escape" key. (Developer's release 6)
