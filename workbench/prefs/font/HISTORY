0.1 (20.3.2001)		First version. Features IFF-PREF import/export and a font sensitive
			gadtools GUI. (Internal release)
0.2 (24.3.2001)		ReadArgs() support with Release 2 template. Structural changes to 
			handleiff.c. (Internal release)
0.3 (3.4.2001)		Font knows how to deal with gadtools menus. (Developer's release)
0.4 (5.4.2001)		Font now stores its data in big endian format to remain AmigaOS compatibly.
			Additionally, the "PRHD" IFF "Preferences Header" chunk is shrunk by two
			bytes for compatibility reasons. Fixed a couple of minor bugs. (Internal 
			release)
0.5 (5.4.2001)		Two more menu options have been added ("Open" and "Save As"). IFF parsing
			slightly altered. Project file "getfile.c" removed - code moved to new file
			"asl.c" (Developer's release 2)
0.6 (9.4.2001)		The "Edit" menu has been added with its three items. The items have been
			assigned the proper code. "init.c" has been cleaned up resulting in a new
			function - "initDefaultPrefs()". (Internal release)
0.7 (19.4.2001)		The "code flow" of "Font" Preferences has been dramatically changed in order
			to pave way for a more polished source code. The internal API has changed;
			we are not backwards compatible with earlier versions! Gadtools GUI has been
			totally reworked - most parts rewritten. (Developer's release 3)
