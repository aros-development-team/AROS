(1)	The current implementation of "Font" Preferences is rendered as
	"alpha" class software. Nothing is guaranteed to work at this level.
	Everything may or may not be subject to change. The current state of
	"Font" Preferences does not represent nor reflect the first public
	release.

(2)	This is a "Developer's Release". The primary purpose for this relase
	is to allow for other parties to report on this softwares stability
	and reability. The sources contain certain amounts of code intended
	for debugging purposes. This code will be eventually be removed.

(3)	As long as "Font" is at "alpha" class development, the source code
	isn't formatted according to the AROS standardized syntax. This is
	subject to change prior to the first public release.

(4)	At this point, the sources are not very well organized nor optimized.
	General overhauls are of priority and will be issued at a later
	stage.

(5)	The author of "Font" Preferences for AROS cannot be held responsible
	for any kind of damage caused by the software. You are using this at
	your own risk.
