Public Screen Inspector is a part of MagicUserInterface 3.8 created by Stefan
Stuntz. Sources of Public Screen Inspector are freely distributed in MUI 3.8
SDK for educational purposes.

I got permission from Stefan Stuntz to include Public Screen Inspector and
its source code in AROS. Thank you Stefan!
