41.0 (11.09.2013)       Rewrite ReqTools Prefs using Zune/ AROS System Prefs objects.

38.283 (01.10.2001)     ReqTools Preferences now uses WaitPort() instead of Wait(), tapping
                        several signalports at once, now including CTRL-C signals. Support
                        for IDCMP_VANILLAKEY has also been added. Currently, ReqTools only
                        responds to "escape" key presses. Finally, ReqTools now sports a
                        standard window closegadget and the corresponding IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW
                        event notification to go with it.
