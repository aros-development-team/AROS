Rain Blanker

by Michael D. Bayne

This module rains on your screen. It draws drops
hitting the screen.

Consequently, this was the easiest blanker I have
written to date. It took me 10 minutes from the
time I made a copy of the shell code until I had
what you see here. If only all of them could be
so simple (I bet I've spent over 100 hours
messing with the Life blanker for example).
