TicTacToe Blanker

by Michael D. Bayne

This module plays tic tac toe against itself
for your viewing pleasure. If you set all the
delays to zero, it looks quite remniscient of
the Tic Tac Toe playing computer in the movie
War Games.

I still have to make it draw O's by stroking
out a circle instead of just drawing the whole
thing at once.
