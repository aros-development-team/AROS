Species Blanker

by Michael D. Bayne

This is an interesting cellular automaton I read
about. Essentially, the screen is filled randomly
with 15 different "Species". Each iteration, if
any species is neighbored by species+1 it changes
to species+1. The interesting stuff starts to happen
if you let it go for a bunch of iterations.
