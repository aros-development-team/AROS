Golden Spiral Blanker

by Michael D. Bayne

This module isn't really done. It's based on
the Mathematical Recreations in the December '94
issue of Scientific American. It makes for a
neat effect (note the forward and reverse spirals)
but I'm not sure if there's much I can do to make
it cooler. So if you don't like it, there's always
the "Toggle" button.
