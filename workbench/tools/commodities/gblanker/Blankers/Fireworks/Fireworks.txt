Fireworks Blanker

by Michael D. Bayne

Alex ported the SuperDark fireworks
module a while back, and I got really
annoyed with the way it was written so
I rewrote this one from scratch and
included some neat stuff: Like, if you
have only four colors it will throw a
copper list up for color 3, so some of
the fireworks will change colors as they
descend.
