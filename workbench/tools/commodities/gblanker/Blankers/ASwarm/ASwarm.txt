ASwarm Blanker

by Alexander Kneer and Michael D. Bayne

Alex ported this from SuperDark who had
ported it from whomever wrote ASwarm
originally which was a port from the X11
screen lock program. I then optimized it
a bit to give you what you have here: a
blanker that draws wasps and bees on the
screen where the wasps run around and
the bees chase the wasps.
