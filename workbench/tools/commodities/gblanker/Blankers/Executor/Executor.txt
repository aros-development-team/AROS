Executor Blanker

by Michael D. Bayne

This is a very versatile blanker. You simply
enter a command to run to start the blanker in
"Startup" and one to make that program exit in
"Kill" and the possibilities are endless.

One that I use:
Startup = SYS:Utilities/FJpeg FOREVER DELAY=5 SYS:Media/Visual/Images/#?/#?.jpg
Kill = SYS:Bin/Kill SYS:Utilities/FJpeg

Another good option:
Startup = SYS:Rexxc/RX Startup.rexx
Kill = SYS:Rexxc/RX Kill.rexx

And put whatever you want in the rexx scripts.
