	gui.c is too big!

1.
	After changing/creating partitions, saving that changes, leaving
	HDToolBox and rebooting AROS (soft reboot), the "Boot Shell" process
	might crash

2.
	MUIA_Window_Sleep doesn't work yet.

3.
	ptclass (resize/move partitions) doesn't work correctly if you move a
	partition over the beginning of the table. In that case it jumps back
	to the last position.

4.
	ptclass (add, resize/move partitions) doesn't handle LMB clicks correctly.

5.
	filesystems are not supported yet.

6.
	Configuration must be edited by hand (maybe Prefs program?).

7.
	Not much error messages.

8.
	New partitions are not yet mounted, changed ones are not yet updated
	if possible.
