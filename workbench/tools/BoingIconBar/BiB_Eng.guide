@node description " What is it ? "

    This program creates a toolbar with icons similar to AmiDock,
    to which it can be an alternative.
    It requires:

    AmigaOS 3.5+
    AmigaOS 4.x
    MorphOS 2.x
    AROS

    There is a separate version of a program for each system.

    Toolbar supports icon types used in:

    a) AmigaOS 3.5+

    - plain icons (4 colours)
    - MagicWB
    - NewIcon
    - GlowIcon 32
    - GlowIcon 256 - only with icon.library ver. 46.4.191+

    b) AmigaOS 4.x

    - plain icons (4 colours)
    - MagicWB
    - NewIcon
    - GlowIcon 32

@node Installation "Installation"

   Installation of this program is very easy and it can be done manually:

   1. Copy the settings of the program to ENVARC: and ENV:

   2. Copy the file, suitable for your operating system, to WBStartup or
     to any other place that you like and then run it from user - startup.

   3. Copy the BiBPrefs file to Sys:Prefs

   In the "bibgfx" folder you can place three gfx files, which can be
   used as a background (option):

     left - left edge of the background
   middle - middle
    right - right edge of the background

   You can only use file "middle", the rest is not required.
   
   New for AROS: gfx files are installed in SYS:System/Images/bibgfx.

@node configuration "How to operate and configure"
@wordwrap
    After running without any parameters the program always runs hidden.
    In order for it to be visible you have to go down with your mouse pointer near the middle part of the screen and wait about one second.

    After that time the toolbar with icons should appear on your screen.
    The change of the levels can be done using:

        a) scroll in your mouse
        b) after pressing the right mouse button and choosing the option form the menu
        c) with keys; @{B}F2@{UB} - next level, @{B}F3@{UB} - previous level

    There are additional keyboard shortcuts:

    @{B}LShift + ESC @{UB}- exit program
    @{B}F1@{UB} - executing REMAP function on icons to the actual colour palette
        ( check AUTOREMAP parameter )


    Available options & parameters (valid as icon tooltypes):

    @{FG HighLight}SPACE/N/K@{FG Text} - an interval between the icons measured in pixels, default option is set to 5 pixels

    @{FG HighLight}STATIC/N/K@{FG Text} - if we want our toolbar to be visible after having been run, you have to specify this parameter with a number bigger than 0. This number informs us about the time in seconds after which the window will be displayed on the screen e.g. during the start up of the operating system.

    @{FG HighLight}AUTOREMAP/S@{FG Text} - this parameter is unavailable for MorphOS users. It can happen that the icons might be displayed inappropriately, e.g. after choosing an option from the menu of Workbench "Tools -> ResetWB". Using this parameter causes automatic remapping of icons to the actual colour palette, before displaying the toolbar.
   
    @{FG HighLight}BACKGROUND/S@{FG Text} - (AROS only) Displays the toolbar background images.
        Images are:
            SYS:Sytem/Images/bibgfx/left
            SYS:Sytem/Images/bibgfx/middle
            SYS:Sytem/Images/bibgfx/right

    Additionally, there is a one more parameter for MorphOS users:

    @{FG HighLight}SIZE/N/K@{FG Text} - Icon scaling. Icons will be displayed in their standard size without this parameter. Stating the number bigger than 0, causes icon scaling every 16 pixels e.g.
        1 - icons will have a size of 16 pixels
        2 - 32 pixels
        3 - 48 pixels
        etc.
