2005-04-11  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

    * doc/MCC_TextEditor.guide: general rework - fixed typos and grammar;
      dropped the fancy V40+ formatting to make maintenance easier
      (sorry Allan :o); put the old (<15.10) changes in a separate page;
      documented the historic HD recovery... TODO: installation, arexx,
      credits and more
    * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: no longer highlights the LGPL tidbit (it
      would be unreadable against a white background otherwise, which
      would be quite common for a text editor :); fixed typos and grammar;
      reformatted to be more readable; made the usage and arexx parts
      match what the guide says; added the missing KILLLINE, TOUPPER &
      TOLOWER ARexx commands; no longer refers the user to the AUI
      Style Guide for documentation that belongs to local docs; fixed
      wrong copyright attribution (copyright for the open source code
      begins in 2005, not in 1997)
    * mcc/rev.h, mcp/rev.h: changed copyright mark "(c)" to "(C)" for
      being generally better accepted though still not legally binding
    * doc/MCC_TextEditor.doc: likewise

2005-04-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * includes/mccheader.c: updated common MCC include file to reflect the
      latest changes done in the nlist.mcc project.
    * includes/mccclass_68k: replaced the assembler based OS4/68k stub by a easier
      manageable C-based variant.
	 
2005-04-10  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

    * mcc/library.c: Request rexxsyslib.library V36 (KS 3.1) instead of V38.

2005-04-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * all: last preparations for the 15.10 release. bumped version date and
      such.

2005-04-08  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

    * mcc/SpellChecker.c: Now compiles without OS4 headers too.
    * mcc/TextEditor-Test.c: Fixed MorphOS build.
    * includes/SDI_hook.h: Changed MorphOS hooks to use HookEntry stub.

2005-04-08  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * TODO: Added two more entries (italic letter problem, tabs)

2005-04-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: fixed incorrectly formatted about text.
    * mcp: added missing ENTRY() calls to the Dispatchers which are required
      by the MorphOS build. However, this required to put the Create/Delete
      of our subclasses into Dispatcher.c, but now the mcp should hopefully
      work on MorphOS as well.

2005-04-07  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

    * doc/MCC_TextEditor.doc: fixed typos, corrected grammar, reformatted
      to make it a bit more readable and adapted to the new state of
      affairs (LGPL)

2005-04-07  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc/SpellChecker.c: Reimplemented the search path feature also
      for systems not having a recent workbench.library. Code is mainly
      untested but the core is taken from YAM with permission from
      Jens Langner. So TextEditor-mcc is still LGPL ;)
      Note that this code is not included within the OS4 compile so
      this feature requires at least version 44 of workbench.library
      here. But this is a tautology.
    * mcc: No longer uses static hook declarations within functions,
      because same code of a mcc can be executed by several tasks!
    * doc/MCC_TextEditor.doc: Warn about unpredictable results of
      forbidden placement of some escape sequences for the plain import
      hook.

2005-04-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>
 
    * mcc: fixed OS3 build as well and removed all remaining compiler
      warnings.
    * mcc/Dispatcher.c: fixed recently broken OS4 build due to latest
      MorphOS changes.

2005-04-06  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

    * mcc: Removed compiler warnings for MorphOS build.

2005-04-06  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc/ImportHook.c: Changed behaviour of FindEOL() not to return NULL
      if the text only consits of a 0 byte. This fixed bug #1177619. 

2005-04-05  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc: Clipboard handling for copy/paste was totaly broken (don't
      confuse clipboard.device with console.device ;) ). Now only one 
      pointer is used within the instance data for the clipboard io
      request.
    * mcc: Reimplemented Workbench path search support when starting shell
      commands (e.g. for the spell checkers). This however requires at
      least version 44 of workbench.library (coming with OS3.5)
    * mcc: Finished complete reimplementation of the import hooks. Because
      the nature of a reimplementation, the behaviour of the new functions
      might be different and even buggy. Exporting also works in the
      meantime.

2005-04-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/ImportText.c: fixed bug where an empty MUIA_TextEditor_Contents
      string didn't clear the texteditor area.
    * mcc: removed the last bunch of compiler warnings and made the
      custom class compile with -DDEBUG disabled.

2005-04-01  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc: Now clears the area before the text near the cursor is
      redrawn. Fixes bug #1172355 aka "anti alias bug". This is no
      april fool ;)
    * mcc: Started to reimplement all of the import and export hooks
      which were 68k asm before

2005-03-31  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc: Fixed buffer overflow which happened if the font name was 
      longer than 27 chars.
    * all: Enforce amiga align for the keybinding structure because
      this is exported to the settings file and has to be compatible
      with the 68k version.

2005-03-31  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * all: Source cleanup and minor OS3 makefile changes.

2005-03-31  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcp: modified preferences sources to use flexcat to generate
      the locale.c,h files out of the new TextEditor_mcp.cd and C_?.sd
      files instead of having a static locale interface.

2005-03-31  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

    * mcp/locale/TextEditor_mcp.cd: added

2005-03-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * initial LGPL release published at sf.net
