Items that ought to be implemented in future TextEditor.mcc releases:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix the problem that parts of italic letters are erased (happens only
  if fonts are anti aliased)
* Better tab handling (import hooks, real tabs)
* Implement more different Import/Export hooks.
* Change all import/export hooks to use a flex template whereever possible.
* Inline image display
