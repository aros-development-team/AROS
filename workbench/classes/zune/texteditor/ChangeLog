#### v15.41 RELEASE ############################################################

2013-04-25 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v15.41 release preparations
  * include/muiextra.h: added definition of MUII_PopFont as some MUI SDK might
    not have them yet.

2013-04-24 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/locale/greek.ct: updated greek translation kindly provided by Antonis
    Iliakis.

2013-04-22 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: use the font popup button image for MUI 3.9+.

2013-03-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/mccinit.c, include/shellstart.c: rearranged the code to ensure that
    trying to start the final class from a shell does not crash.

2013-01-11 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/AllocFunctions.c, misc: removed the wrapper functions for allocating
    and freeing a line as they covered a single line only.

2013-01-10 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/AllocFunctions.c, mcc/EditorStuff.c, mcc/BlockOperators.c: check for
    possible references before removing/freeing a line, as getting the line's
    preceeding or successing line after it has been removed from the line list
    might dereference invalid pointers. This closes bug #107.

2013-01-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/HandleInput.c: for externally handled double clicks (i.e. the double
    click hook) the not yet happend mouse release event will nevertheless be
    treated as occured. Before it might have happened that the double click
    hook launches a program which steals the focus and leaves the object
    pending in a "mouse pressed" situation. This will result in an immediate
    marking action as soon as the object regains the focus. For example this
    happens when a URL is double clicked in YAM and if launching the browser
    takes some seconds. This closes bug #106.

2012-12-22 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * tools/mkrelease: add italian catalog to the release archive.

#### v15.40 RELEASE ############################################################

2012-12-20 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v15.40 release preparations

2012-11-29 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/MixedFunctions.c, mcc/PrintLineWithStyle.c: apply MUIPEN() to all pen
    values allocated by MUI_ObtainPen().

2012-11-19 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/Pointer.c: make use of the standard mouse pointer images in the AmigaOS4
    build if intuition.library 53.37 is available.

2012-09-20 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/ObjectCreator.c: don't trigger notifications in
    MUIM_Mccprefs_ConfigToGadgets.
  * mcp/ObjectCreator.c: save strings with their real length only instead of
    their maximum length to assist MUI4's realtime prefs.

2012-09-12 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/Dispatcher.c, mcc/InitConfig.c: apply the current configuration before
    calling the superclass' MUIM_Setup to ensure the frame settings are applied
    correctly.

2012-09-03 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/locale/italian.ct: updated italian translation kindly provided by Samir
    Hawamdeh.

2012-09-02 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: the floattext object on the Spellchecking page now
    accepts wheel scroll events.

2012-09-01 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/locale/italian.ct: added italian translation kindly provided by Samir
    Hawamdeh.

2012-08-31 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: fixed a redraw bug due to a wrong index check when
    deleting characters at the end of a wrapped line.

2012-08-28 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: adjusted the crawling text to better match the
    capabilities of Crawling.mcc.
  * mcc/HandleInput.c: added support for the standard cut, copy, paste, undo and
    redo keys of MUI4.

2012-08-27 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/SetBlock.c: added missing block enabling when style changes were
    requested along with setting the now block. Thanks to Andreas Falkenhahn for
    the hint.

2012-08-24 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/Navigation.c: fixed several "use before check" occurences.
  * mcc/HandleInput.c: fixed wrong handling of DEL key at the end of a line.
  * mcc/misc: removed all the senseless distinction between "fast" and "slow"
    background images. This makes the code a lot more understandable.

2012-08-22 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: moved a check to a more appropriate location to avoid
    leaving a function somewhere in the middle.
  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: fixed a potential out of bounds access of the text line to
    be printed.
  * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: check the index to inside the array bounds before
    accessing the array.
  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: apply all further changes to a line only if a possible
    expansion has succeeded before.
  * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: removed all the handling of anti-aliased fonts. The
    background area affected by redraw operations will always be cleared now no
    matter what type of font is used.

2012-08-21 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: fixed an endless loop when splitting a non-empty line
    into two new lines.

2012-08-20 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: put the line counting code into a separate function to
    reduce code replication.
  * mcc/PrintLineWithStyles.c: limit the drawing of the background of unwrapped
    lines to the visual area.

2012-08-16 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/BlockOperators.c: simplified the cutting block function prototypes to
    carry less parameters and avoid double negation.
  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: fixed a memory leak when pasting clipboards without using
    styles or colors.
  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: if things like right alignment or highlighting are found
    in the clipboard these will be treated as clipboard entries created by TE.mcc
    itself and everything will be restored correctly now.

2012-08-15 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/BlockOperators.c: implemented a new function to mark the complete text.
  * mcc/PrintLineWithStyles.c: correctly respect the maximum visibile width of
    the object when drawing the text. This fixes bug #3558290.
  * mcc/PrintLineWithStyles.c: don't print any text if there is no space left
    for at least one character.

2012-08-14 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/GetSetAttrs.c: treat a NULL content pointer as an empty text. Otherwise
    setting a NULL content will have no effect.
  * mcc/GetSetAttrs.c: enabling/disabling the object will cause a redraw event
    only if the state really changes and MUI4 is not available.

2012-08-09 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/misc: avoid copying styles and colors too often.

#### v15.39 RELEASE ############################################################

2012-08-05 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v15.39 release preparations

2012-08-02 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/InitConfig.c: restrict certain configuration values to their configurable
    limits.
  * mcc/GetSet.c, mcc/InitConfig.c, mcc/ImportText.c: added a new function to
    reimport the current text with modified TAB size or TAB conversion mode. This
    fixes the issues that may arise when the user has configured a custom TAB
    size and an application has set a text containing TAB characters before the
    class was able to access its configuration, i.e. before opening the window.
    This changes ensures that the text will always be correctly displayed with
    the configured TAB size.
  * mcc/GetSet.c, mcc/InitConfig.c: added a new attribute MUIA_TextEditor_TabSize
    to let an application enforce a specific number of spaces per TAB character
    no matter what the user has configured.

2012-07-20 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/GetSetAttrs.c: fixed a potential memory leak in case importing a text
    failed. In this case the former text buffer was not freed.

2012-07-12 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: use memmove() instead of strlcpy() when moving characters
    backwards as the regions may overlap.
  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: rely on the existing line length information instead of
    calculating it from scratch when inserting or removing characters.

2012-07-09 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: added some more boundary checks when inserting or
    deleting a range of characters. I hope this makes it possible to track down
    those mysterious crashed during UpdateChange().
  * mcc/Dispatcher.c, mcc/ImportHook.c: assume a default TAB size of 4 spaces
    per TAB. The "Wetter" application tries to import a text before the
    configuration has been parsed and this left the class with a TAB size of
    zero which then was used to replace TAB characters by spaces. This closes
    bug #3536338.
  * mcc/misc: replaced several indirect object pointers by direct ones.
  * mcc/misc: removed a global variable to keep the object's top position. This
    value is better obtained by using _mtop(obj).

2012-06-20 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/KeyStorage.c: don't allocate locked memory here as well and replaced an
    AllocMem() call by AllocVec().

2012-06-19 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/misc: don't allocate locked memory.

2012-05-16  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * mcp/locale/swedish.ct: updated and some minor corrections.

2012-05-14 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/Makefile: removed .catalog files in clean target.
  * mcp/locale/TextEditor_mcp.cd: replaced non-7bit-ASCII character by a
    suitable sequence.

#### v15.38 RELEASE ############################################################

2012-05-12 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v15.38 release preparations
  * mcc/Makefile: restored the -DNO_INLINE_STDARG define in CFLAGS as otherwise
    our AROS cross-compilers won't build for these targets and raise some
    "untermated macro" errors when building our test applications.
  * doc/TextEditor.guide: removed the whole "History" section as we solely
    rely on the ChangeLog in future as it is too much work to update the .guide
    for every new release.

2012-05-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/HandleInput.c: restored the correct return code interpretation of the
    double click hook that was inverted in r756. Now everything is conformant to
    the Autodocs again.

2012-04-07 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc: the graphics library TextLength() function is now used for situations where
    only a fixed string is used, thus no \t can be in there.
  * mcc/NewGfx.c: removed the xoffset dependance in TextLengthNew() and TextFitNew()
    as I can't see any reason for that? In addition, this fixes the problem that
    the number of pixels required in ConvertTabs mode and non-ConvertTabs mode
    wasn't equal for an instered TAB.

2012-04-05 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * ImportText.c, ImportHook.c, misc: changed ImportHook to also allow to specify
    the number of spaces that should be used to convert tabs to spaces if this
    operation is wanted.
  * Keybindings.c, MCC_TextEditor.doc: changed default NextGadget keybinding to
    use RCOMMAND+TAB instead of ALT+TAB because ALT+TAB is already taken by MUI
    itself for switching windows.
  * mcc: renamed 'RealTabs' to 'ConvertTabs' and made it default to TRUE so that
    the old behaviour is reserved where TE.mcc always converts \t to spaces.
  * mcc: removed the global TabSizePixels variable and moved it into the instance
    data including reworked Text*New() functions in NewGfx.c.
  * mcc/HandleInput.c: when a TE.mcc object has been active and the TAB has was
    used the action always ended up in activating the next object in the
    CycleChain as the new active object. However, when using the TAB key in an
    editor the action should always end up in either storing real tabs (\t) or in
    storing a number of spaces into the object according to the current settings.
    However, this was not possible at all.

2012-04-05 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/HandleInput.c: fixed handling of the TAB key as real input key.

2012-04-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/GetSetAttrs.c: added missing #include.

2012-04-04 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/*: applied patch kindly provided by Nicolas Rybkin. Please note that
    the functionality provided by this patch is not complete yet. But it should
    provide basic functionality which will allow to put real tabs (\t) into a
    texteditor (if the developer enabled this). Currently TE.mcc only supports
    replacing tabs by a various number of spaces. With the patches provided
    TE.mcc should be able to allow to press the TAB key and see \t to end up
    in the buffer. However, as mentioned, the patches are not yet complete
    and need some more work to end up in the final release.
  * Makefile: got rid of -funroll-loops option as this one is potentially
    dangerous under certain circumstances.

2012-04-02 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/InitConfig.c: string pointers obtained from the MUI configuration must
    be copied instead of rembembered directly. With MUI4's realtime prefs the
    pointer might become invalid at any time and hence the class would operate
    on invalid data after that.

2012-02-16 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/ColorOperators.c: fixed adding new colors in case there was no color
    used at all yet on a line.

2012-01-29 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * Backport of AROS fixes.
    SDI headers updated.

2012-01-10 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/HandleInput.c: mouse wheel events happening over the slider object are
    now handled in the same way as over the editor object. This makes scrolling
    speed to be the same no matter where the mouse pointer is located.

#### v15.37 RELEASE ############################################################

2011-11-26 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v15.37 release preparations

2011-01-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * all/Makefile: fixed the dependency generation to respect the system specific
    object file path.

2010-11-17 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/HandleInput.c: slightly deobfuscated the double click handling.
  * demo/TextEditor-Demo.c: obtain/release the pens in the MUIM_Setup/Cleanup
    methods instead of MUIM_Show/Hide.

2010-10-05 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: make sure that removing the library during LibClose()
    really operates on the correct base. Calling LibExpunge() on MorphOS is
    wrong, since that takes no parameter but expects the base to be in A6. We
    work around this by using an additional function which gets called from
    LibClose() and LibExpunge() with the correct base pointer.

#### v15.36 RELEASE ############################################################

2010-09-23 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v15.36 release preparations

2010-09-18  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * mcp/locale/swedish.ct: new file generated by FlexCat 2.7.

2010-09-14 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/Methods.c: trying to clear the contents of an already instance of TE.mcc
    caused an error message, because there was nothing to be deleted. Now the
    deleted text is added to the undo buffer only if it really exists. This fixes
    ticket #209 of YAM.

2010-09-08 Mariusz Danilewicz <mandi@interia.pl>

  * AUTHORS: added translators section (please check and update missing persons).

2010-09-07 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mccinit.c: added missing #include <string.h> for memset().

2010-09-03 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mccinit.c, #?/ClipboardServer.c: updated to the latest version and clear all
    embedded semaphore structures before calling InitSemaphore().

#### v15.35 RELEASE ############################################################

2010-09-01 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v15.35 release preparations

2010-08-17 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mccinit.c, SDI_compiler.h: updated to latest versions.

2010-08-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/#?: replaced lots of direct references to MUI's area data and render
    info by the appropriate macro calls. This way we can rid of some private
    variables which are just copies of these values.
  * mcc/PrintLineWithStyle.c: added a TextFit() call to calculate how many
    characters can really be displayed. This works around the problem that very
    long lines would either be drawn outside the editors area or were not
    correctly displayed at all due to integer overflows in graphics.library.

2010-07-30 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/Debug.c, mcp/Debug.c: removed unused debug flags from the .mcp and made
    @mtrack user definable for both classes.
  * mcp/Makefile, misc: added missing functions for the OS3 debug build.

2010-07-29 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcp: fixed MorphOS compile by applying debugging framework from mcc also
    on the mcp.

2010-07-07 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/HandleInput.c: the text was no longer refreshed in case the user tried
    to paste from an empty or non-text clipboard.

2010-07-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/Methods.c: clearing the complete text is now remembered as an action
    without cursor movement. Undoing this action will result in the cursor being
    placed on the very first character of the text instead of behind the very
    last character.
  * mcc/misc: use the SetAfPt() macro instead of poking directly into the
    RastPort structure.

2010-07-05 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: replaced the text editor object containing the
    instructions about the spell checking facility by a plain float text object.
    Having a flow blown editor is far too much overhead here.
  * mcc/UndoFunctions.c: defined a separate value for a "do nothing" undo step
    which can be used to erase any other undo step type.
  * mcc/UndoFunctions.c: fixed a possible memory leak when resizing the undo
    buffer. A resize from any number of steps to zero steps would not have freed
    any undo steps done so far.

2010-07-03 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/ObjectCreator.c: removed the "undo steps" slider from the real time
    settings facility of MUI4 completely. First, adjusting the value will give
    no visual feedback. Second (and even more important), adjusting the number
    of steps in real time will effectively kill all undo steps so far in case
    the slider is moved to zero. This is not what the user expects to happen.
    MorphOS-devs, please check the other GUI elements if some of them can be
    excluded from the real time settings as well. Furthermore, please check if
    this change fixes bug #3024024.

2010-07-02 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/UndoFunctions.c: the undo buffer will be preserved in case the number of
    undo steps is modified.
  * mcc/UndoFunctions.c: a modified number of undo steps will now trigger the
    notifications for MUIA_TextEditor_Undo/RedoAvailable.
  * mcc/UndoFunctions.c: in case there is not enough memory for a new undo step
    (i.e. a too big block) only this single step will be discarded instead of
    all remembered steps so far.
  * mcc/UndoFunctions.c: in case the number of undo steps is decreased the steps
    which don't fit into the new buffer are freed correctly now.

#### v15.34 RELEASE ############################################################

2010-07-01 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v15.34 release preparations

2010-06-30 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * Makefile: fixed the top-level Makefile to only compile for the standard
    platform found by the separate Makefiles in each subdirectories.
  * tools/mkrelease.sh: minor fixes to the mkrelease script to generate a complete
    new release archive.

2010-06-29 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@yahoo.com>

  * mcc/Makefile, mcc/private.h: Use standard AROS GetHead/Pred/Succ/Tail
    macros in MorphOS.

2010-06-29 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/locale/swedish.ct: added ##codeset line.

2010-06-27 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * doc/MCC_TextEditor.guide: fixed wrong version information. This fixes bug
    #3021781.

2010-06-11 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Install-MCC: extended the final message that a reboot might be necessary to
    be able to use the just installed version.

2010-06-10 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/misc: moved all sources which implement stuff which is missing on some
    systems to a separate "extrasrc" directory.

2010-06-09 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/Get#?.c: added GetHead/Pred/Succ/Tail implementation for those systems
    which don't implement these natively.
  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: use the growing tables as well when removing characters
    and the style/color information needs to be updated. This should have been
    the last place for possible buffer overruns if removing some styled text
    resulted in more style changes than before.

2010-06-07 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/misc: replaced all hand crafted style and color array allocations by
    growing arrays which are resized on demand. This makes buffer overruns
    due to imprecise size calculation impossible and should fix the random
    crashes.

2010-05-25 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * Fixes for 64-bit AROS: changed some ULONG to IPTR to get rid of warnings like
    "conversion from/to pointer to/from integer with different size"

2010-06-03 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: fixed an off-by-one string copying.

2010-06-02 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c, mcc/HandleARexx.c: replaced some memcpy() calls by more
    apropriate strlcpy() calls.
  * mcc/AllocFunctions.c, mcc/#?VecPooled.c, mcc/Makefile: moved the
    #?VecPooled()functions for OS3 to separate files.
  * mcc/ClipboardServer.c: removed the ENTER()/LEAVE() macro calls from the
    server process' function as these are cluttering up the debug log.

2010-06-01 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mccinit.c: added CleanupDebug() call to expunge function.
  * Debug.c, misc: implemented a basic check to verify that stuff is being freed
    using the correct function, i.e. FreeVec() for AllocVec()'ed memory.
  * Debug.c: fixed slightly wrong string parsing.

2010-05-31 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: fixed a possible memory leak.
  * mcc/EditorStuff.c, mcc/Dispatcher.c: replaced some free line loops by a call
    to FreeTextMem().
  * mcc/BlockOperators.c, mcc/ImportHook.c, mcc/HandleARexx.c: minor code
    cleanup.

2010-05-27 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * dist/Install-MCC: the supported languages are now collected dynamically
    instead of being defined statically. Furthermore the .mcc name must be
    specified in the script's icon as application name. This makes it possible
    to use the script for arbitrary classes without modification.
  * dist/icons: set some reasonable default icon positions.

2010-05-26 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/locale/polish.ct: added a missing comment.

2010-05-26 Mariusz Danilewicz <mandi@interia.pl>

  * mcp/locale/polish.ct: translation of MSG_HELP_CURSOR_SELECTED corrected

2010-05-25 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * mcp/mmakefile.src: icon.c added
  * mcp/locale/TextEditor_mcp.cd: one string corrected
  * mcp/locale/french.ct: there was a more recent version
    in the AROS source
  * include/mccinit.c: updated with fixes for AROS V1 API

2010-05-25 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/HandleARexx.c: fixed a NULL pointer access when the "SELECTNONE"
    command was invoked without any text being selected before. This closes
    YAM bug #165.
  * mcp/locale/polish.ct: added missing final LF character.
  * dist/Install-MCC: added the first version of a generic MCC Installer script.
    To use this script for other classes only the name and the set of supported
    languages needs to be adapted.

2010-05-24 Mariusz Danilewicz <mandi@interia.pl>

  * mcp\locale\polish.ct: added Polish translation
  * tools\mkrelease.sh: added generating Polish catalog to release
  * mcp\makefile and mmakefile.src: added generating Polish catalog

2010-05-20 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Makefiles: add varargs stubs only for those systems which really need it.

2010-05-18 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

 * mcc/UndoFunctions.c: use memmove() instead of memcpy() to shift the undo
   steps as the buffers definitely do overlap due to the in-place operation.
 * mcc/Methods.c: clearing the text of a read-only instance will no longer add
   the deleted text to the undo buffer. This fixes bug #3003238.
 * mcc/UndoFunctions.c: trying to perform any undo/redo action on a ready-only
   instance will let this action fail.
 * added stuff for automated build of release archives.

2010-05-17 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

 * mcc/SpellChecker.c: slightly improved the setup of the Rexx messages to avoid
   accessing possible NULL pointers.

#### v15.33 RELEASE ############################################################

2010-05-16 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v15.33 release preparations

2010-05-10 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/AllocBitMap.c: fixed wrong freeing of a memory block in case another
    allocation failed. This only could affect classic systems.
  * mcc/AllocFunctions.c: integrated the OS3.0 Alloc/FreeVecPooled() functions
    as well as the AllocLine()/FreeLine() functions into the memory tracking
    framework.

2010-05-07 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/InitConfig.c: fixed wrong pen allocation.

2010-05-05 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: fixed a wrong deallocation which might have lead to a
    crash (FreeVec instead of FreeVecPooled).
  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: after converting a text clip from UTF8 the line content
    pointer is now updated correctly. This fixes bug #2995825.

#### v15.32 RELEASE ############################################################

2010-04-30 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v15.32 release preparations

2010-04-30 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/library.c: added version check for NBitmap.mcc. Only version V15.8+ can
    handle raw image data.

2010-04-28 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcp/icon.c: now the new NBitmap.mcc is explicitly used for displaying the
    32bit raw image data on OS3 and OS4.

2010-04-28 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/library: implemented experimental fallback to NBitmap.mcc for raw image
    data in case Rawimage.mui is not available.

2010-04-27 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/library: all systems now try to create a truecolor prefs image using
    Rawimage.mcc first before falling back to the old 8bit images.

2010-04-26 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/misc: merged all converted image data into one file, moved the image
    files to a separate subdirectory, combined the prefs icon generation for
    all platform into one function.

2010-04-24 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest version. This fixes the stack swapping
    for AROS.

2010-04-23 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@yahoo.com>

  * mcp/misc: use bzip2 compressed 32bit prefs image on MorphOS 2.

2010-04-22 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * ColorOperators.c, StyleOperators.c: the GetColor() and GetStyle() functions
    now handle invalid positions internally.
  * ExportHook.c: cleaned up the plain export function a bit for better under-
    standing.
  * BlockOperators.c: deleting a multiline block would have dropped any coloring
    information and thus the block would be restored uncolored at an Undo
    operation.
  * HandleInput.c, UndoFunctions.c: erasing a single character using the
    Backspace key is now handled like erasing a marked block. This seems to be
    overkill on the first sight. But the former backspace handling did not take
    any coloring into account and undoing such an operation resulted in lost
    colors.
  * HandleInput.c: erasing a single character using the DEL is now handled like
    erasing a marked block for the same reasons as for the Backspace key.
  * UndoFunctions.c: correctly free a ET_DELETEBLOCK_NOMOVE clip like it is done
    for ET_DELETEBLOCK clips.
  * HandleInput.c, UndoFunctions.c: erasing a character with DEL will leave the
    cursor at the same position when undoing this operation.

2010-04-21 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * EditorStuff.c: slight optimization to shift style and color changes only if
    they need to be shifted when deleting text.
  * BlockOperators.c: fixed the increasing amount of color changes without real
    color changes being applied. Blocks with color changes must be correctly
    terminated with a color change back to the default color.
  * EditorStuff.c: finally fixed a long standing coloring bug. This one occured
    when inserting a colored clip into a line without any color changes yet.
    After undoing and redoing this operation the line was colored until the end,
    because the implict color change at the end of the clip was not correctly
    handled. This is really weird stuff!

2010-04-20 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Debug.c: added new debug flags DBF_IMPORT and DBF_EXPORT to debug the import
    and export hook functions.
  * ImportHook.c: added some debug messages to the plain text import hook.
  * BlockOperators.c: added the missing color handling when deleting a marked
    block and restoring it afterwards using the Undo function. I hope I didn't
    miss any case. This stuff is still far from being easy to understand.
  * UndoFunctions.c: a pointer was not cleared after a FreeVecPooled() call and
    might have been freed a second time and thus causing crashes.
  * ImportHook.c: optimized the import hook a bit to only apply real style
    changes instead of every style operation. Furthermore we ensure that all
    applied styles are unapplied at the end of the imported text.
  * BlockOperators.c: all applied colors changes are unapplied correctly.

2010-04-17 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c, mcc/UndoFunctions.c: removed the "highlight" warnings by
    implementing the undo/redo of highlighted lines as well. However, Does this
    really change something? And what about colored text? How can be undo/redo
    colored text as well?

2010-04-12 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/misc: added 32bit truecolor prefs image done by Martin 'Mason' Merz.
    This requires at least MUI3.9 and AmigaOS 4.1.

2010-04-12 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/SetBlock.c: reworked the whole text boundary checking before the SetBlock
    operations because it was largely broken and potentially caused crashed in case
    a developer requested operations outside avaiable text areas. In addition two
    new special values MUIV_TextEditor_SetBlock_Min/Max allow now to specify the
    start/stop values for minimum and maximum.
  * mcc/StyleOperators.c: fixed a minor compiler warning where the in-place
    invertation via '~' caused a compiler warning with GCC 4.4+

2010-02-10 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/AllocBitMap.c: the CyberGraphics semaphore check was done without the
    necessary Forbid()/Permit() pair. Although it is absolutely unlikely that
    the semaphore will be removed it is better to follow the rules. This fixes
    bug #2948533.

2009-11-28 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/ClipboardServer.c: decreased the stack size from 16K to 8K as the server
    process doesn't really need much stack.

2009-11-09 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/misc: implemented MUIA_TextEditor_PasteColors/Styles to enable/disable
    pasting text with color and style information. This fulfils feature request
    #2807448.
  * mcc/GetSetAttrs.c: modifying the MUIA_TextEditor_AutoClip attribute treated
    the tag as if it was TRUE always thus making it impossible to deactivate it.
    This fixes YAM bug #2894042.

2009-10-26 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/UndoFunctions.c: adding a new entry to the undo buffer will erase any
    previously done redo action. This is what all text editors do. Additionally
    this fixes a double free of memory upon cleanup.

#### v15.31 RELEASE ############################################################

2009-10-24 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final release preparations

2009-10-21 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/ImportHook.c: the import hooks didn't set the allocation size of the
    contents in the line structure which caused bogus error messages in the
    debug log and caused trashed memory when a line had to be expanded.
  * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: the recently changed ExpandLine() and CompressLine()
    functions used the wrong length. This could lead to visibly truncated lines.
  * mcc/BlockOperators.c, mcc/ExportHook.c: avoid allocating zero sized buffers
    and make sure not to produce memory leaks when getting a block's contents.
    An empty last line caused leaks and false error messages about not enough
    memory for the undo buffer. This was yet an other of Allan's ancient bugs...
  * mcc/Debug.c: added BLOCK debug class.

2009-10-20 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/TextEditor-Test.c: the debug stuff was initialized after the starting
    the clipboard server which requires a fully set up debug environment.
  * mcc/ColorOperators.c, mcc/StyleOperators.c, mcc/ImportHook.c: added a
    missing #include.

2009-10-19 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/SpellChecker.c: the spell checker no longer treats a missing ENV:Found
    variable as a failure and thus will no longer DisplayBeep() in this case.
  * mcc/misc: added an allocation size counter to each line to get rid of the
    necessity to peek around in memory to get an allocation's size.

2009-10-12 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/misc: added a proper definition for "no separator" and use it all over
    the place.
  * mcc/misc: cleaned up the dispatcher a bit. Now all method functions have the
    usual class/object/message parameters.

2009-10-09 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/BlockOperators.c: cutting a line to the clipboard and deleting complete
    lines will now free the attached color informations as well. Before only the
    text and the styles were freed which means this was a potential memory leak.
  * mcc/Dispatcher.c: the OM_DISPOSE method will now free all lines together
    with their contents, styles and colors. Although we are using a per-instance
    memory pool this is not absolutely necessary to avoid memory leaks, but it
    is bad style to rely on such features.
  * mcc/Debug.c: implemented the memory tracking for the debug build as known
    from YAM to catch possible memory leaks.

2009-10-08 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/UndoFunctions.c: when reusing an undo entry the former contents were not
    erased and could lead to double freeing if that entry contained a clip of
    pasted or deleted text. Now the contents are always cleared.

2009-10-07 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/misc, mcp/misc: again *LOTS* of code cleanup to make this monster more
    readable and understandable.

2009-10-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/Debug.c, mcc/SpellChecker.c: added the SPELL debug flag to get some
    debug output from the spell checking process.

2009-10-05 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/SpellChecker.c: added the usual ENTER()/LEAVE() macro calls.
  * mcc/UndoFunctions.c, mcc/Methods.c: fixed a double FreeMem() call and a
    copy'n'paste bug which prevented a proper redraw after undoing the deletion
    of a text block.
  * mcc/StyleOperators.c: added a missing notification when the style changed
    from bold to non-bold.
  * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: removed the "+-5" part from the undo level slider,
    because the new Undo/Redo management doesn't need these additional steps
    anymore.
  * mcc/UndoFunctions.c: reimplemented the complete Undo/Redo handling from
    scratch. Before lots of temporary pointers were used and had to be kept in
    sync, which most probably did not always happen. It is really amazing how
    complicated such a trivial handling can be implemented. Shame on you, Allan!
  * mcc/misc: *LOTS* of code cleanup. This code is a real mess! I really wonder
    what kind of mysterious crashes are still lurking in there :(

2009-10-02 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/misc: added some house keeping variables to the style and color handling
    to detect possible buffer overruns. These also make it possible to get rid
    of peeking around to get the size of a previous allocation.

2009-09-29 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/ClipboardServer.c: added the missing NP_CodeType=CODETYPE_PPC tag for
    the MOS build.

2009-09-25 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: fixed a bug which treated columns numbers as color
    numbers.
  * mcc/misc: fixed some LONG variable to BOOL, as this is what they really are.

2009-09-24 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/misc: replaced the complete embedded clipboard stuff by a server process
    which does the dirty stuff. This fixes the issue that opening two write
    windows in YAM made pasting text impossible.

2009-09-21 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/Dispatcher.c: added a name the memory pool for the OS4 build.

2009-09-07 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/misc: replaced all custom "end of color" markers by a proper definition.

2009-09-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: fixed yet another crash when removing lines. This old
    handling was a *real* *big* *mess*. Exploiting features of the C language
    is cool, as long as other persons understand it without asking more than
    twice. This stuff really was *far* beyond!! :(

2009-08-31 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: fixed another style handling bug which lost some styles
    when pasting a text with styles from the clipboard.
  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: fixed another recently introduced bug which caused random
    crashes because a pointer was not handled correctly. It seems at least the
    crashes are gone now, but there are still issues when pasting text with
    styles. This only works in the first column or if the text is pasted twice.
    The good news is that this also happened with the old style handling.

2009-08-30 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: replaced accidental "+" by "*". This might have caused
    the recent crashes in case there were lots of different colors in one line.

#### v15.30 RELEASE ############################################################

2009-08-30 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final release preparations

2009-08-28 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/UndoFunctions.c: changed the return code of some functions from "long"
    to "BOOL" as this is what they really return.

2009-08-27 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/misc: replaced the complete array based style and color stuff by proper
    structures which carry the starting column and style/color information
    around. This makes the whole stuff much better understandable and by far
    better maintainable. I really hope I did all the conversions right and
    didn't mix up anything. So far all tests have been successful.
    Also replaced the absolutely ugly peeking into the ULONG ahead of an
    allocation to obtain the allocation size in bytes by a proper function call.

2009-08-25 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: fixed a bad bug which made TE.mcc loose track about the
    styles and colors being in use. Added a function to dump all informations
    about a single line to track this one down.

#### v15.29 RELEASE ############################################################

2009-08-23 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcp/library.c, misc: fixed the version string and prepared everything for a
    new official release.

2009-08-21 Gianfranco Gignina <sh1nkur0 at libero.it>

  * mcc/all : Inserted special comment strings to better read
    sources on CubicIDE

2009-08-14 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Makefiles: added "-g" to the debug flags. It seems the OS3 GCC 2.95.3 cross
    compiler needs this to generate debug infos at all.

2009-08-03 Gianfranco Gignina <sh1nkur0 at libero.it>

  * mcc/CaseConversion.c : now ToUpper and ToLower operations
    are can be reverted by user;

2009-06-30 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/HandleArexx.c, mcp/KeyStorage.c: fixed two warnings.

2009-06-27 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * include/libraries/mui.h: backport of an AROS related fix.
  * misc: some warnings removed

2009-06-18 Gianfranco Gignina <sh1nkur0 at libero.it>

  * Implemented MUIF_TextEditor_Search_Backwards for MUIM_TextEditor_Search.

2009-06-15 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * mmakefile.src : new file SetBlock added
  * demo/mmakefile.src : created
  * demo/TextEditor-Demo.c: some warnings removed

2009-06-11 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/SetBlock.c, mcc/ExportBlock.c: fixed the SetBlock logic to check each
    flag after another instead of allowing only one flag. This is exactly what
    the autodoc for SetBlock suggests. In addition, several things have been
    cleaned up to better match our general code layout.

2009-06-11 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/ExportBlock.c, mcc/SetBlock.c: replaced some hand crafted flag checks by
    our isFlag#?() macros.
  * mcc/Makefile, include/mui/TextEditor_mcc.h: fixed completely broken Makefile
    and include file. Gianfranco, please make sure to check in working files
    without any unfixed conflicts!

2009-06-11 Gianfranco Gignina <sh1nkur0  at libero.it>

  * Implemented MUIM_TextEditor_SetBlock and modified MUIM_TextEditor_ExportBlock
    to get block giving to it coordinates, see autodoc for more details.

2009-06-08 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * AROS metamakefiles added
  * Re-added some fixes from previous AROS port
  * Some 64-bit fixes.

2009-06-06 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: revised the whole build system again to be somewhat more useable for
    AROS compiles. Now everything should compile/link fine for all AROS
    targets as well.

2009-06-02 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: added missing variable initialization.

2009-06-01 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: added safety check before pasting new characters into a
    line to prevent potential buffer overruns. Hopefully this fixes the still
    happening random crashes on OS4.
  * mcc/MixedFunctions.c, mcc/PrintWithStyle: the font soft style is reset after
    each operation to avoid unwanted behaviour.

2009-05-11 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: converted all tabs to spaces
  * version.h: fixed the identification of a PowerPC processor as the AROS
    compiler for ppc does not set __PPC__.

2009-05-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/SDI_lib.h: updated to the latest version.

2009-05-02 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * include/mccinit.c: RTF_EXTENDED was not set for the MorphOS build making
    revision number ineffective.

2009-04-30  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * updated the SDI headers to their latest fixed versions.

2009-04-18 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/C_c.sd: added missing SDI_compiler.h include to make IPTR type known.

2009-04-17 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/defines/mccclass.h: updated the mccclass.h defines header with the
    one generated with the latest sfdc 1.4 version.
  * mcp/C_c.sd: replaced a (ULONG) cast by the more portable (IPTR) cast.

2009-04-01 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mccinit.c: fixed broken stackswap_call() prototype for the assembler
    version.
  * UndoFunctions.c: fixed some compiler warnings about "void * used in arth-
    metics"

2009-04-01 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: adapted the whole environment to make TextEditor.mcc directly
    compileable for AROS. Now it is possible to compile TextEditor.mcc with
    an AROS cross-compiler for i386,ppc and x86_64.

#### v15.28 RELEASE ############################################################

2009-01-04 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v15.28 release preparations

2008-12-29 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * mcc/AllocBitMap.c: Also MorphOS build is now using AllocBitMap()/FreeBitMap()
    only. For maximum performance VMEM bitmap is used. WaitBlit() is now called
    only for OS3 (CGX and P96 synchronise blitters automatically).

2008-12-21 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/AllocBitMap.c: replaced the OS3 specific part (and the deprecated
    AllocMem and AllocVec calls) by simplified code.

2008-12-17 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * Makefile: removed the printf usage with the ANSI codes and replaced them
    by the more intuitive CC/LD echo output.

2008-12-17  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/ExportHook.c: added some missing NULL pointer checks.
  * mcc/SpellChecker.c: replaced the obsolete CreateMsgPortl() and
    DeleteMsgPort() calls with AllocSysObject() and FreeSysObject() call for the
    OS4 build.
  * mcc/Dispatcher.c: replaced the obsolete CreatePool() and DeletePool() calls
    with AllocSysObject() and FreeSysObject() call for the OS4 build. Also
    restored the old MEMF_ANY memory flags for the other platforms. For OS4
    MEMF_SHARED will be used as before.

2008-12-08  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/Dispatcher.c: added MEMF_CLEAR to the pool's memory flags to make sure
    that every allocation is cleared, as it seems the most prominent crashes are
    caused by unrestricted string accesses (i.e. by strlen() operating after the
    trailing NUL byte).

2008-12-05  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: slightly reworked the obscure width calculation in the
    UpdateChange() function and added a missing LEAVE() macro call.
  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: added the usual ENTER()/RETURN() macros the the UTF8
    conversion function.

2008-11-11  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: when pasting UTF-8 try non-recursive compatibility
    decomposition if equivalent mapping is not found from current keymap.

2008-11-04  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: paste from clipboard now also reads CSET chunk and
    converts UTF-8 text to a local 8bit charset. Charset conversion is
    supported in MorphOS 2 only but could be made available to other platforms
    by using codesets.library respectively.

2008-08-12  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/HandleARexx.c: the GOTOLINE and GOTOCOLUMN commands now return the final
    line/column number instead of the boolean value TRUE. This makes it possible
    to immediately check if the cursor movement has been done correctly. This
    fixes bug #2045395. Note: Don't forget to FreeVec() the returned string as
    stated in the Autodocs!!!!!

2008-07-20  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * mcc/HandleInput.c, mcc/Pointer.c, mcc/private.h: simplified handling of
    custom pointers for MorphOS 2 making code look nicer. Window (layer)
    visibility check is also disabled when running under MorphOS2 (Intuition
    takes care of it automatically).

2008-07-17  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/MixedFunctions.c, mcc/PrintLineWithStyles.c: removed the kerning check
    for proportional fonts upon setting the cursor to a new position. This
    caused no clipping and hence some additional pixels left of the line's first
    character when changing that character to be underlined and then setting the
    cursor somewhere else. Now clipping will be enabled for all proportional
    fonts regardless of any kerning information. This fixes bug #1896999.
    Additonally setting any style (bold, italic, underlined) is now done with
    help of AskSoftStyle() in case a certain font for example cannot be underlined.

#### v15.27 RELEASE ############################################################

2008-06-22 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v15.27 release preparations

2008-06-21 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/HandleInput.c: slightly reverted the last change to achieve a flicker
    free custom select pointer as otherwise a user might end up with the
    standard mouse pointer under some circumstances.

2008-06-20 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/HandleInput.c: fixed the mouse pointer flickering which was present when
    moving the mouse throughout a TE.mcc object.
  * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: fixed a potential NUL pointer access which might have
    caused some crashes.

2008-03-17  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/vastubs.c, #?/Makefile: added vararg stubs for OS3 to be able to link
    against clib2 which misses these stubs.

2008-03-06 Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

   * mcp/locale/swedish.ct: Updated according to changes.

2008-03-04  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Makefile: removed -lm from the linker libs as nothing needs floating
    point math. Also added dump as target.

2008-02-25 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/HandleInput.c: changed the AmigaOS4 WheelX/WheelY scroll wheel
    interpretation to respect the wheel acceleration factor rather than always
    scrolling the same distance. This should increase the scroll wheel speed in
    case the wheel is used more quickly and the wheel acceleration factor is
    properly configured in the SYS:Prefs/Input configuration.

2008-02-19  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Debug.h: replaced all abort() usages in our ASSERT() macros with the
    respective calls to assert(). This should prevent the MorphOS compile
    from not linking and be a bit more intuitiv.

2008-02-18  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/ExportBlock.c: make use of the new flag macros.
  * mcc/TextEditor-Test.c: fixed a typo.
  * mcc/Debug.c: the flag macros are now local to Debug.c as in our other
    classes.
  * mcc/MixedFunctions.c, mcc/Dispatcher.c, mcc/GetSetAttrs.c, mcc/private.h:
    hopefully fixed the "phantom cursor" bug. The inactive cursor was not erased
    properly in all cased leaving visible phantom cursors behind. Now TE.mcc
    remembers the current state of the cursor (active, inactive, off) to perform
    the correct state changes.

#### v15.26 RELEASE ############################################################

2008-02-04 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/BlockOperators.c: fixed a bug in the CutBlock2() function where using
    the RemoveChars() function on an empty top line caused a selected area to
    remain selected, even after the cut operation. This should completely fix
    bug #1884875 reported on the YAM bugtracker.
  * mcc/UndoFunctions.c: fixed a potential source for a memory leak where in case
    some redo operations where still left and the undo buffer was reset via a
    new char, the memory of the former paste operations was not properly freed.
  * mcc/UndoFunctions.c: reworked the whole undo handling to not use any hackish
    address flagging via 0xff to mark the end of an undo buffer. That whole
    process was kinda strange. Now the whole undo level handling should be not
    only more safe, but also more transparent.

2008-02-04  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/BlockOperators.c: adapted two parameters of CutBlock() to reflect their
    true boolean nature.
  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: replaced OptimizedPrint() by a non-recursive function.
  * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: fixed a possible endless loop. This partly fixes bug
    #1884875 of YAM.
  * mcc/UndoFunctions.c: added some "default: break;" statements to please GCC.

2008-02-02 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/misc: minor modification to use uppercase letters for the EventType
    enumeration we use for our Undo operation handling.
  * mccinit.c: updated to latest version available which fixes some
    MorphOS specific compiler warnings.

2008-01-20 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * MixedFunctions.c: fixed bug #1825864 where upon using a non-antialiased font
     together with a small cursor caused the inactive cursor to leave graphical
     traces when reactivating a texteditor object.
   * Dispatcher.c: we catch the result values of the GoActive/GoInactive methods
     of the MUIC_Area supercall and forward it accordingly. Not that this might
     fix something, but well, it seems to be more correct :)

2008-01-04  Vit Sindlar <sindlarv at centrum dot cz>

   * mcp/locale/czech.ct: updated Czech catalog translation.

2008-01-04  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcp/rev.h: fixed broken date string.
   * include/mui/TextEditor_mcc.h: added version requirement to the new
     qualifier in struct ClickMessage.
   * mcc/HandleInput.c: the qualifiers being pressed during a double click are
     now also passed to the DoubleClickHook.

2008-01-03  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcp/locale/#?.ct: changed all .ct file names to english names instead of
     translated ones.
   * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c, mcp/Preference.c, mcp/locale/TextEditor_mcp.cd:
     the undo slide format string is now localizable to avoid character set
     issues because of the plus/minus sign. Also changed the "(R)" sign to a
     "(C)" string, which is in fact more correct.

#### v15.25 RELEASE ############################################################

2007-12-20 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * misc: final release preparations.

2007-12-14  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcc/ImportHook.c: fixed some indentations.
   * mcc/HandleInput.c: the select pointer will now only be shown if the mouse
     pointer is over the object AND over the object's window. If the window is
     partly covered by another window the normal pointer will be shown. This
     fixes bug #1850317.

2007-12-13  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcc/PrintWithStyles.c: fixed some indentations.
   * mcp/misc: replaced the old BitmapObject by a BodyChunkObject and added a
     IFF-ILBM image with proper transparent color. This should fix the broken
     display on the prefs image on some old machines.

2007-12-12  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcc/HandleInput.c, mcc/Methods.c: fixed some indentations and comparisons.
   * mcc/Dispatcher.c, mcc/Pointer.c: the select pointer will now be set and
     hidden in the Show/Hide methods. Hiding it in the Cleanup method is for-
     bidden, because the necessary window is not existing anymore then. This
     fixes bug #1849264.

2007-12-02  Vit Sindlar <sindlarv at centrum dot cz>

   * mcp/locale/czech.ct: added czech mcp catalog translation

2007-11-22  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: changed the return code of some functions to BOOL to
     reflect the true nature of the return code.
   * mcc/EditorStuff.c: added one more scroll command after inserting a single
     character. This should finally fix bug #1812179.

2007-11-11 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

   * mcc/Pointer.c: use system pointers on MorphOS if possible.

2007-11-03 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: added a copyright crawling object to the bottom
     of the mcp to match the Look&Feel to our other classes.

2007-11-03 Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

   * mcp/locale/svenska.ct: Updated according to changes.

2007-11-02  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: added all missing buttons to the cycle chain.

2007-10-29  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcp/locale/TextEditor_mcp.cd: fixed some small typos.
   * mcp/locale/deutsch.ct: Updated according to the latest changes.

2007-10-28  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: corrected some bubble help attributes, as these
     were placed completely wrong (for the sorrounding group instead of the
     intended object).

2007-10-27 David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

   * mcp/locale/TextEditor_mcp.cd, mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: added the missing
     help bubbles to almost everything that was missing them, also reworded
     a few strings.

2007-10-25 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcp/locale/russian.ct: update russian catalog translation kindly provided
     by Michael Malyshev.
   * mcc/HandleArexx.c: when firing an arexx command which did change the cursor
     position, the cursor change was also not propagated to other MUI objects via
     the common CursorX/Y attributes.
   * mcc/HandleInput.c, Methods.c, Dispatcher.c: fixed bug #1819513 where TE.mcc
     didn't propagate a cursor change in all cases via a notify through the
     MUIA_TextEditor_CusorX/Y attributes.

#### v15.24 RELEASE ############################################################

2007-10-14 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/HandleInput.c: fixed a bug in the Backspace key handling where upcon
     concatenating two lines via the backspace key the display may have ended up
     mixed up in case they were concatenated at the visual top of the editor
     gadget.
   * mcc/HandleInput.c: fixed bug #1812179 where pressing return/enter on the
     visible last line didn't end up in the display being scrolled according to
     the vertical cursor change.

2007-10-11  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcc/Pointer.c: the combinated bitplane is now also declared as constant
     data instead of "calculating" it.
   * mcc/Pointer.c: for OS4 the normal bitmap data are now used for the fall-
     back pointer in case the graphic card cannot handle 32bit hardware sprites
     as pointer.

2007-10-07 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: the inactive cursor checkbox will not automatically
     adjust its size automatically to the current height of the window. This
     should prevent the checkbox image to end up in a wide clumsy image being
     shown.

2007-10-04 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/HandleInput.c: fixed bug where a texteditor object didn't ate all
     rawkey events regardless of the fact that it might be the active object
     and in read-only mode.

#### v15.23 RELEASE ############################################################

2007-10-03 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: changed the inactive cursor to always have a width
     of the actual character it resists on. This should be more intuitive and
     obvious.
   * mcp/Makefile: modified makefile to use LOCALE as a variable for the
     locale directory.

2007-09-23 Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

   * mcp/locale/svenska.ct: Updated according to changes.

2007-09-12 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc: implemented new MUIA_TextEditor_ActiveObjectOnClick attributes which
    allows to automatically set a texteditor object as the active object of
    a window in case the user clicks into it regardless of the ReadOnly status.
    However, per default this will be set to FALSE in case ReadOnly is turned
    on. In addition, in inactive state a selection will now be drawn in the
    new inactive color rather than always with the marked color. This should
    make it more obvious if the object has the keyboard focus. Last, but not
    least by clicking into a texteditor object with the CTRL key pressed will
    not clear the selection in case the object is currently inactive.
  * mcp: added new "inactive color" selection where the user will be able to
    select a color for displaying selected text in an inactive color in case
    the texteditor object is set inactive. The color will default to the
    halfshadow pen of MUI which should fit to the other default colors.

2007-09-09 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/Pointer.c: fixed an issue where in case some other gadget/process
    set the window pointer to something else we might have ended up with the
    wrong or no custom pointer at all.

2007-09-02 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/HandleInput.c: an invisible cursor was not automatically made visible
    on certain key events (e.g. Return/Tab, etc). Now a cursor should always
    be made visible as soon as a relevant input key is pressed and right before
    any scroll action might take place.
  * mcc/HandleInput.c: as soon as a key is pressed and the cursor is outside
    the currently visible area, the text is immediately scrolled down/up now
    rather than waiting for the user to release the key. This should be a bit
    more intuitive to what a user might expect to happen.
  * mcc/GetSetAttrs.c, mcc/PrintLineWithStyles.c: The cursor will now scroll
    with the text rather than kept at the very same position relately to the
    window. This should be more intuitive and what a normal user would expect.
    So as soon as the user wants to enter text and the cursor is not visible
    texteditor.mcc will scroll down/up so that it will become visible as
    expected.
  * doc/TextEditor.doc: added missing documentation about the function of the
    MUIA_TextEditor_KeyUpFocus attribute.

2007-09-01 Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

   * mcp/locale/svenska.ct: Updated according to changes.

2007-08-31  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/HandleInput.c: key releases of known shortcuts (like cursor up/down)
    were not handled correctly and caused MUI to trigger the same action a
    second time. That caused double scrolling. Now key releases of the short-
    cuts will be "eaten" as well. This fixes bug #1784873.

2007-08-31 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/GetSetAttrs.c: fixed bug where an initial MUIA_Disabled state for a
    texteditor object in OM_NEW didn't automatically end up in having an added
    slider set disabled as well.
  * mcc/HandleInput.c: an instant scroll operation wasn't possible anymore if
    the texteditor object was currently active because the IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE catch
    operations blocked it.
  * mcc/Pointer.c: tuned the 32bit pointer image a bit to look better on
    both, bright and dark background colors while still maintaining the
    general look&feel of the new pointer.

2007-08-30 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/Pointer.c: the 32bit pointer setup seems to require to have a fake
    bitmap setup passed to the pointer class or otherwise the pointer might
    not be generated properly.
  * mcc/Pointer.c: on OS4 we generally prefer to use the 32bit pointer image
    data and don't do any color identification or use the select pointer
    bitmap at all. However, we still need to get the 32bit select pointer
    ready as we still have just an example image up&running, but it is nice
    to be able to freely define a 32bit pointer on OS4.

2007-08-29  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/Pointer.c: just in case the 32bit pointer cannot be created the old
    bitmap is also passed in again.
  * mcc/Pointer.c: with OS4 a 32bit ARGB pointer will now be used. Currently
    the image is just 2bit and very simple, but just to get the idea...

2007-08-29 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/PrintLineWithStyles.c, mcc/Dispatcher.c: the text will now always be
    rendered right from the top rather than layouting it vertically centered
    throughout the available space. This should fix the common vertical text
    floating when resizing a window which is redrawn with every resize operation.
  * mcc/Dispatcher.c: when the gadgeted will be hided via a MUIM_Hide call we go
    and hide the selection pointer as well. This should make the selection pointer
    disappear as soon as a texteditor gadget is in a register group and gets
    hided as soon as the group is switched.

2007-08-28 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc: propaged the new mcp option to enable/disable the selection pointer to
    our corresponding mcc routines. Now a user can disable the selection pointer
    in case he finds it annoying/unnecessary. But per default it will be enabled.
  * mcp: implemented a new settings option to be able to enable/disable the new
    selection pointer.

2007-08-27  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/Pointer.c: when setting up the pointer image the colors matching white
    and black best are now calculated instead of guessed. This way the pointer
    will have the most correct colors regardless of the user defined palette.

2007-08-27 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/Pointer.c, misc: the pointer object will now be create/destroyed in the
    Setup/Cleanup methods of the class rather than before any show/hide operation
    of the pointer. This should also fix problems where the mouse pointer isn't
    hided/restored when the texteditor is cleaned up by MUI.
  * mcc: when the mouse pointer is now over an active TextEditor object, a
    specialized mouse pointer image for selection of text will be shown
    instead of the default system mouse pointer image. Currently it can not be
    disabled via the mcp, but this should be the case until the final release
    of a new stable version. In addition, not all situations like Hide/Show
    are catched to disable/enable the mouse pointer image.

2007-08-26 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/EditorStuff.c: fixed bug #1779587 where in SoftWrap mode, the MergeLines()
    function didn't take correctly respect of the fact that by merging lines
    upon pressing "backspace", the amount of visual lines may perfectly increase
    and therefore ended up in a distorted text display. Now the ScrollUp/ScrollDown
    operations are done right before redrawing the content of the merge lines.

2007-08-25 Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

   * mcp/locale/svenska.ct: Updated according to changes.

2007-08-22 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/mcp: on request, the inactive cursor introduced in 15.22 can now be
    explicitly disabled in the preference program to get back the old behaviour.
    However, it will still be enabled per default to make use of it at all.

2007-08-13  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to 1.10 version which fixes a wrong memory
    access to the StackSwap structure if this is placed on the stack.

2007-08-10  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcc/HandleInput.c: a read-only editor with a marked search result could not
    be scrolled by keyboard anymore if that would scroll the marked text out of
    the visible area. I am not sure if this change has any impact on other
    functions, so please test.

2007-08-09 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to 1.9 version which includes fixes for the
    stack swapping calls on MorphOS kindly provided by Ilkka Lehtoranta.

#### v15.22 RELEASE ############################################################

2007-07-25  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/library.c: now really uses the 3 parameter version of GETINTERFACE()
    defined in mccinit.c instead of the old obsolete version in mcc_common.h.
    The user definable functions (i.e. ClassInit()) must be declared before
    the inclusion of mccinit.c.
  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.8 version which really uses the
    GETINTERFACE() macro with 3 parameters.

2007-07-25 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * PrintLineWithStyles.c: replaced 0xc0 minterm by "(ABC|ABNC)" which in
    fact will do the very same, but is more descriptive.
  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.7 version
  * misc: adapted MEMF_#? allocation flags to use MEMF_SHARED whereever
    appropriate.

2007-07-24  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.6 version which fixes an unbalanced
    if statement.

2007-07-24 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * PrintLineWithStyles.c: the inactive cursor wasn't drawn when the window in
    which the gadgets resists was being resized. Now the inactive cursor
    should always be layouted.
  * HandleInput.c: when resetting the previous cursor position we make sure
    the gadget is flagged as activated or otherwise a reactivated gadget might
    not reset the cursor sign properly and end up in multiple inactive cursor
    signs being shown.

2007-07-22 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: added new MUIA_TextEditor_WrapMode attribute which can now be set to
    either NoWrap, SoftWrap or HardWrap to set the wanted word wrapping mode. Whereas
    HardWrap is the default as in previous versions, SoftWrap should be considered
    the new setting that should be used in new and revised applications as it allows
    to set the number of characters at which the texteditor will soft wrap word, but
    keep them logically together. This allows to easily concatenate lines by just
    e.g. removing characters again. NoWrap, in contrast, will completly disable word
    wrapping and will require a user to enlarge the gadget himself to fit the text as
    currently TextEditor.mcc can't scroll horizontal.
  * MixedFunctions.c: when the gadgets is in inactive/unactivated state, the cursor
    will be drawn by just its outline to make it easier to identify where it last
    resisted when the gadget is being activated again.

2007-07-18 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.4 version which uses a new inline
    assembler version for those platforms where a StackSwap() is required (e.g.
    MorphOS/AmigaOS3).

2007-07-04  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: put the StackSwapStruct structure on the stack to avoid
    crashes.

2007-07-04 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.3 version which introduces a stackswap
    mechanism for OS3/MorphOS systems so that they may not run out of stack when
    running through the various library initialization routines.

2007-07-01 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.2 version which fixes some library
    manager initialization issues.

2007-06-25  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: the number of undo levels can now be set by the application. A value
    of zero means that undo/redo is completely disabled. It is also possible to
    disable undo/redo globally by setting the level to zero. This fulfils
    feature request #1479534.

2007-06-20  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/locale/french.ct: updated the french translation which kindly has been
    provided by Alexandre Balaban.

2007-06-18 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * EditorStuff.c, MixedFunctions.c, Navigation.c, private.h: as the LineCharsWidth()
    function can now return 0 all usage situations have to make sure that they can
    handle a zero return value. This should e.g. fix an endless loop situation when
    tripleclicking on a line.

2007-06-13  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Debug.c: unified the _DPRINTF() functions for all platforms.

2007-06-10 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * #?/Makefile: minor update/optimization on Makefiles.
  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.1 version which should fix possible
    stack issues during the LibInit() phase. Custom libraries will now be opened
    during the LibOpen() phase instead while maintaining an own mutual exclusive
    locking variable.

2007-06-09 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccinit.c, mcc/library.c, mcp/library.c: replaced the old obsolete
    mccheader.c by the new mccinit.c which should come with a much more clear
    interface and documentation on how to use it for a basis of a MUI custom
    class. This should significantly reduce the possibility of race conditions
    in the mcc/library init code.

2007-05-29  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/mccheader.c: reworked the LibOpen() and LibClose() functions to
    increment/decrement the lib_Open counter before obtaining the semaphore to
    prevent a possible race condition with LibExpunge().

2007-05-18 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * MixedFunctions.c: minor twirks to the LineCharsWidth() function to catch
     a possible issue when calculating the string length.

2007-04-16 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcp/locale/dansk.ct: added new danish translation kindly provided by
     Niels Bache.

2007-03-23  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * #?/Debug.c: fixed wrong final output of debug classes and flags.

2007-03-11 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcp/locale/russian.ct: applied patch to russian catalog description
     updates, kindly provided by Vinny Vinogradov.

2007-03-11 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * #?/Debug.c: disabling a debug flag was not possible due to a check for the
     '!' at a wrong index.

2007-03-10 Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

   * mcp/locale/svenska.ct: Updated according to changes.

#### v15.21 RELEASE ############################################################

2007-03-07 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcp/KeyStorage.c, mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: fixed bug #1669685 where due to
     an incorrect iteration through the keybindings structure, TextEditor.mcp
     crashed on OS3/m68k setups.
   * mcc: replaced all get() uses with the more save xget().
   * mcc/HandleArexx.c: the HandleArexx() function was returning a 'BOOL'
     which wasn't entirely correct as it might also return a string on commands
     like 'GETCURSOR'. In that case it might have happend that the result
     variable was truncated and caused and unexpected crash.
   * mcp/Makefile: added 'catalogs' target to Makefile so that catalogs can
     be generated on-the-fly more easily.

2007-03-02 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcp/locale/deutsch.ct: updated the german translation according to the
     latest changes.
   * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: the version check for Hotkeystring.mcc didn't
     handle future versions correctly (i.e. 13.0). A too old object is also
     disposed before the creation fails to let the user install a new version
     without the need to reboot.

2007-03-01 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: added a check if the required Hotkeystring.mcc
     class could be found and if it is the minimum required version we need.
   * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: replaced compile time _ASSERT() with our new
     runtime ASSERT() in Debug.c,h.

2007-02-28 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcp/locale/deutsch.ct: fixed wrong warning text.
   * mcp/locale/deutsch.ct: added updated german translation. I hope this one
     is a little bit better than the old one.
   * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: the Snoop button is no longer deactivated auto-
     matically but must be deactivated manually. Before it was not really
     possible to enter combinations of qualifiers and keys, because as soon as
     a qualifier was pressed the snopping was deactivated.

2007-02-27 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcp/KeyStorage.c: hotkey parsing doesn't use loops anymore to prevent un-
     predictable side effects. Also added some safety check before accessing
     the KEY argument to prevent possible NULL pointer accesses.
   * doc/MCC_TextEditor.doc: the new MUIM_TextEditor_QueryKeyAction method was
     missing in the table of contents and was not properly sorted in the range
     of all methods.

2007-02-26 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/Keybindings.c: updated the default keybinding in the MCC according
     to the recent changes in the MCP (RSHIFT->SHIFT change).
   * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: fixed bug in the Popobject popup hooks which
     contained a wrong indexing and therefore did select the wrong item in the
     poplist of the keybindings.

2007-02-26 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcp/Keybindings.c: changed all occurences of IEQUALIFIER_RSHIFT to
     IEQUALIFIER_SHIFT as it unnecessary to force the user to use a specific
     shift key.

#### v15.20 RELEASE ############################################################

2007-02-25 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/HandleArexx.c: added new "SELECTALL"and "SELECTNONE" Arexx commands
     to be able to also perform the same actions via the ARexx interface.
   * mcc: introduced a new MUIM_TextEditor_QueryKeyAction method that allows
     to retrieve the key code and qualifier information for a specified action.
     Please note, that this method normally returns the direct RAWKEY value
     and that for a vanilla key identification an offset of 500 is added.
   * mcc/Methods.c: modified MUIM_TextEditor_MarkText method to allow to select
     ALL and NO text of the texteditor according to the new SelectAll and
     SelectNone actions.
   * mcc/HandleInput.c: the 'SelectAll' and 'SelectNone' key actions should
     work now as expected.
   * mcc/mcp: synced the internals how the default keybindings are managed and
     exported the key action value to the _mcc.h file. This should allow to
     provide a method in future to query the keybinding of a keyaction for
     third party applications. In addition, "Select All" and "Select None" was
     added to allow for keybindings of selecting all/no text with a RCOMMAND+A
     hotkey.
   * mcc/HandleInput.c: changed the automatic word wrapping mechanism to find
     the wrap position around the user-specified WrapBorder value instead of
     always word wrapping at the cursor position only. This should make the word
     wrapping behaviour more consistent.

2007-02-18 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcp/KeyStorage.c: key combinations like "shift up" were always converted
     to "shift right" because of a wrong index calculation.

2007-01-29 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcc/Dispatcher.c: the OM_NEW method must be handled before the instance
     data are retrieved, because nobody can predict what INST_DATA() will return
     if it is invoked on a not yet created object. This can explain the random
     crashes on OS4 when TextEditor.mcc tried to access unallocated memory.

2007-01-28 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcp: renamed the GetStr() locale translation function to the much shorter
     tr() naming and adapted all files to it.

2007-01-27 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcp: fixed several non-critical compiler warnings.
   * Makefile: removed all target specific (os4,os3,mos) makefiles and replaced
     them with a single 'Makefile' for all our sub-projects. This new makefile
     includes methods to automatically identify the HOST and TARGET opererating
     system and compiles the sources for the found target OS. In addition, that
     Makefile can be used to also compile for all supported targets via
     'make OS=XXX' where XXX is the abbreviation for the operating system.

2007-01-02 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * misc: updated all copyright notices to 2007.
   * mcp/locale/french.ct: added french mcp catalog translation kindly
     provided by Philippe Bovier.

2006-12-02 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/private.h: minor code restructuring to prepare for a larger debug
     session so that we finally can hunt down that "crashes on YAM startup" with
     TextEditor.mcc involved.

2006-11-27 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * mcc/EditorStuff.c: when pasting a clip which contained some colors or
     styles we trashed memory because the allocation was always 2 bytes too
     small. This happend because TextEditor.mcc terminates the color and style
     arrays with special values which are not included in its own clipboard
     files and hence their length isn't contained in the IFF header length.
   * Debug.c: added correct copyright header and fixed some typos

#### v15.19 RELEASE ############################################################

2006-11-12 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/BlockOperators.c: fixed a bug where not the whole ExportMessage
     structure was cleared and caused the Undo/Redo functionality to end up
     broken.
   * mcc/ExportBlock.c: fixed a minor issue with the new ExportBlock functionality
     where unmarked text wasn't exported correctly due to an old marking structure.

2006-10-17 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

   * mcc/EditorStuff.c: Fixed Wipeout hit in PasteClip() where NULL termination
     could accidentally trash innocent memory.
   * mcc/BlockOperators.c: Removed MorphOS workaround and adjusted code to work
     on all flavours.

2006-10-13 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

   * mcc/BlockOperators.c: Added workaround to serious bug in iffparse.library
     supplied with MorphOS. Library barfs when the same chunk is pushed again.
     While this bug is fixed in V51 version of iffparse.library we must settle
     for this solution for now. In order to keep MorphOS specific code short
     style and color information is not stored.

2006-10-11 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

   * mcc/Debug.c: added a dummy abort() function to fix non-OS4 debug builds.

2006-10-08 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/SpellChecker.c: fixed bug #1545493 where the spellchecker routines
     didn't correctly supply the whole word under the cursor and always stripped
     one char at the end. That rendered the spellchecker functionality kinda
     useless.
   * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: fixed bug #1385277 where on a fresh object where
     the MUIM_Setup method never was used, the LineCharsWidth() function
     caused a crash if the InsertText method was used.
   * mcp/Makefile.os4, mcc/Makefile.os4: modified to always keep function
     symbols in the binary, even in release mode.
   * mcc/ExportBlock.c, misc: implemented new MUIM_TextEditor_ExportBlock
     method which will export only the currently marked text instead of the
     whole text like it's ExportText variant. Implemented an additional
     MUIF_TextEditor_ExportBlock_FullLines flag symbol which will export all
     complete lines where marked text was found on.
   * mcp: adapted build to new public header file in 'includes' directory.

2006-10-07 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/TextEditor_mcc.h: removed and merge content into a public header
     file located in the 'includes' directory instead.
   * mcc/ExportHook.c: added new MUIV_TextEditor_ExportHook_NoStyle which will
     export all text, but strip all ESC sequences.

2006-10-06 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * includes/SDI_hook.h, misc: updated to latest version and adapted our whole
     Dispatcher functions accordingly.
   * mcc/classact: removed unrequired subdir.

2006-10-03 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * misc: removed all that ClassAct stuff, as TextEditor.mcc is an MUI class
     only now.

2006-10-03 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

   * Debug.c: added new 'clipboard' debug class.
   * mcc/EditorStuff.c: fixed bug #1462840 by replacing the handcrafted IFF
     parsing routine by calls to iffparse.library. Pasting clips from
     PageStream did not work, becasue PGS embeds FORM-FTXT chunks in CAT-CLIP
     files. The old functions just recognized simple FORM-FTXT files.
   * mcc/BlockOperators.c: replaced all handcrafted IFF writing functions by
     calls to iffparse.library. This makes it much easier to extend clip
     handling. The complete handcrafted access to clipboard.device is gone now.
   * mcc/SpellChecker.c: FindPort() was called without being surrounded by
     Forbid() and Permit().
   * mcc/TextEditor-Test.c, mcc/library.c: added necessary definitions of
     IFFParseBase and IIFFParse to make use of iffparse.library
   * Makefile.os4: removed "-pipe" from all CFLAGS definitions, because the OS4
     native GCC doesn't seem to handle this correctly.

2006-09-27 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * HandleARexx.c: fixed a recently introduced bug where the Arexx support was
     somewhat broken.
   * Debug.c: added new 'arexx' debug class.

2006-09-25 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * misc: general minor cleanup of certain areas. added -Wwrite-strings to all
     GCC makefiles. That should make sure we don't accidently write into const
     strings.

#### v15.18 RELEASE ############################################################

2006-08-18 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * misc: final 15.18 release preparations.
   * all: replaced all non bufferoverflow safe functions like sprintf() with
     bufferoverflow safe variants. This should hopefully increase the stability
     of TextEditor.mcc once more.

2006-08-15 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/ExportHook.c: fixed bug #1493239 and #1376640 where the ExportHook()
     functionality didn't correctly NUL-terminate the exported strings and
     therefore caused problems with the Undo/Redo functionality.

2006-08-14 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * demo/TextEditor-Demo.c: added Makefiles for all 3 major targets and
     fixed all still existing compiler warnings and problems when compiling
     the demonstration program.

2006-07-07 Mathias Parnaudeau <mathias.p@wanadoo.fr>

   * demo/TextEditor-Demo.c : After deep changes it now compiles and runs
     with vbcc, GCC and SAS/C (tested on MorphOS and OS4) [bug #1376518].
   * mcc/Dispatcher.c : Added the support of MUIV_TextEditor_InsertText_Top
     and MUIV_TextEditor_InsertText_Bottom [bug #1416562].

2006-06-12 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

   * mcc/GetSetAttrs.c: MUIA_Font now returns the text editor font always
     (patch by Mathias Parnaudedau).

2006-06-01 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

   * mcc/SpellChecker.c: fall back to manual search path duplication if
     WorkbenchControl() call fails. MorphOS is shipped with workbench.library
     having version number greater than 44 but search path routines were not
     implemented until V50.16. Disabled WBCTRLA_FreeSearchPath for MOS because
     it does nothing in the most MOS installs.

2006-04-13 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcp/KeyStorage.c: adapted MEDIA key definition to latest OS4 SDK.
   * Makefile.mos: moved the .comment section strip definition to its more apprpriate
     section (the top-level programs definition is just for overriding the command
     name by the user).
   * Makefile.os4: switched to newlib compilation/linkage per default and removed
     the unecessary -ldebug link definition.
   * Debug.c: replaced the KPutFmt() use by direct calls to OS4 exec debug functions
     were appropriate.
   * mccheader.c: added support for OS4/newlib use and slightly reintroduced
     some of the parts previously stripped by Gunther. We really should prefer
     code readability instead of minimizing passages.

2006-04-10 Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

   * include/mccheader.c: Fix ROMTag for non-OS4 systems.
   * mcc/Makefile.mos, mcp/Makefile.mos: remove comment section.

2006-04-05 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mccheader.c: slightly reworked the library init/expunge/open/close
     interface to make the library handling a bit more robust.

2006-01-17 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcp/locale: added russian catalog translation kindly created and
     provided by Michael Malyshev

2005-12-09 Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

   * mcp/private.h (FunctionName): Make "char *".
     mcp/ObjectCreator.c (FunctionName): Adapt.
     (PrefsObject): Use loops to initialize arrays.

#### v15.17 RELEASE ############################################################

2005-12-07 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/HandleInput.c,Methods.c: fixed the long-standing bug #1286500 where
     TextEditor.mcc deleted/overwrote certain text passages if the mouse was
     initially used to position the cursor within some text. This really was
     a very old bug, very hard to reproduce and very annoying. But due to
     the help of the reporter of that bug it was much more easier to identify
     and eliminate. Thanks AlexC.

2005-08-16 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/Dispatcher.c: fixed a crash bug in the MUIM_Setup function where we did
     forgot to initialize the font pointer if no explicit font was configured by
     the user.

2005-08-11 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

   * mcc/Makefile.mos: Added 'dump' rule to actually make some use of debug
     binaries. Didn't change other makefiles (probably not interesting).

2005-08-08 Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

   * mcc/ExportText.c, mcc/TextEditor-Test.c, ChangeLog: Fix typos.

2005-08-07 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc: reverted ilkka's fix on VisualHeight() because it didn't catch all
     cases which gave trouble on a hidden TextEditor object. Now all TextFit()
     and TextLength() functions always use a temporary rastport for finding
     out the text limits. In addition, some checks for data->rport and
     data->shown were added to various functions such that a texteditor object
     should not crash anymore if it is used in a hidden state (e.g. hidden in
     a registergroup)

2005-08-06 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/AllocFunctions.c: implemented new AllocLine/FreeLine functions where
     certain operations during the allocation/memory freeing times can be
     performed to ensure the consistency of certian other structures. In fact
     by adding checks for the global blockinfo structure in FreeLine() a
     crash bug is now fixed that occurred when having deleted some empty
     lines at the end of a document.
   * mcc/ExportHook.c,ExportText.c: fixed another bug in the undo/redo
     processing where TextEditor.mcc did always strip the last newline char
     of a line due to the bugfix of bug #1227680. Now the proper bugfix for
     that bug is located in ExportText.c instead.

2005-08-03 Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

  * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c/CreatePrefsGroup (editpopupdata): Move GetStr()
    calls into a separate loop to save stackspace and to reduce programsize.

2005-08-02 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * mcc/Debug.c,mcc/Debug.h,mcp/Debug.c,mcp/Debug.h: Fixed KPutFmt() to use
    VNewRawDoFmt() call in MorphOS for proper vararg handling.
  * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: Added proper test for antialiased fonts in MorphOS.
  * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: Fixed VisualHeight() to not call LineCharsWidth()
    when object is not visible. Editor no longer crash in a hidden state when
    inserting text.

#### v15.16 RELEASE ############################################################

2005-08-01 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: fixed a bug #1249673 in the SetCursor() function where
     on use of a non antialiased font, the cursor background was not successfully
     cleared and caused the cursor to leave graphical trails.

#### v15.15 RELEASE ############################################################

2005-07-31 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/ImportHook.c: fixed bug #1235375 that caused the EMail import hook not
     to stop analyzing a string at the line end and caused e.g. single slashes in
     a line to set text to italic if some other text on more lines contain a
     slash as well.
   * mcc/ExportHook.c: fixed bug #1235756 where the ExportHook always cleared out
     the last character of an export operation instead of checking for the
     particular newline character we wanted to clear. This had the effect that the
     undo/redo operations of TextEditor was slightly broken and did always redo
     one character less that the undo operation cutted.
   * mcc/Dispatcher.c: fixed bug #1246944 where the use of MUIA_TextEditor_Columns
     seemed to have caused crashes because the rastport was not completly ready
     at the time the AskMinMax() method was called by MUI. Now we take the
     nominal fontwidth size attribute tf_XSize instead of using TextLength(), so
     that this function should now also hopefully match the column with a bit
     better.

2005-07-30 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/HandleInput.c,Dispatcher.c: added IDCMP_EXTENDEDMOUSE support to
     catch the new wheelmouse events supported since intuition.library
     v51.28+ in AmigaOS4.
   * mcp/KeyStorage.c: changed the rawkey based wheelmouse name to carry
     a "nm_" prefix so that it refers to newmouse based wheelmouse events
     and doesn't conflict with the new wheelmouse events in AmigaOS4.

2005-07-25 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

   * mcc/ImportHook.c: fixed a minor bug in the ImportHook routines where
     upon an import of bold/italic/underline via escape sequences always
     terminating grow elements where inserted for all possible soft-types.

2005-07-14 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

   * mcc/TextEditor-Test.c: Request version 36 of rexxsyslib for AmigaOS
     3.0/3.1 compatibility.

2005-07-07 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/library.c: added missing USEDCLASSESP define so that MUI knowns
      which mcp class belongs to the mcc.

2005-07-05 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: fixed another possible signedness problem which
      might have caused problem with characters > 127 and was found by Georg
      Steger.

2005-07-04  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

    * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: Antialias font detection didnt work in MorphOS
      (there isn't FSF_ANTIALIAS flag) and cursor background was not cleared
      accordingly. Rather assume font is always antialiased what is true in
      most cases.

#### v15.14 RELEASE ############################################################

2005-07-02 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/ImportHook.c: fixed bug #1229129 where the new "EMail" import hook
      didn't correctly parse lines with typical email like highlight chars,
      which in fact caused applications using this import to display some
      hightligthed sections incorrect.
    * mcc/Search.c: fixed bug #1231207 where the MUIM_TextEditor_Search method
      was broken due to a changed datatype.
    * mcc/HandleInput.c: fixed a bug where after having tripleclicked on an empty
      line, another normal click on another line caused the empty line to stay
      marked.

2005-07-02 Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * doc/MCC_TextEditor.doc: Described that for other import hooks than the
      plain hook, escape sequences have to be supported as well, as some
      progams have insisted on this former undocumented "feature".

2005-06-30 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/HandleInput.c: if the user tripleclicks on a character that is
      a separating character the texteditor previously didn't allow to mark
      the whole line. Now always the whole line is marked if the user
      tripleclicks somewhere on a line.
    * mcc/PrintLineWithStyles.c: fixed a minor bug in the text marking display
      routines where on centered and right aligned lines not always the whole
      line was correctly displayed as being marked. Now it should be fairly
      better, however the current solution still doesn't cover all cases and
      probably requires a rewrite in some day in future :)

2005-06-28 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/HandleInput.c: fixed bug #1229170 where due to a signedness problem
      characters with a code >128 couldn't be typed in under OS3.

#### v15.13 RELEASE ############################################################

2005-06-26 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/PrintLineWithStyles.c: fixed a bug where we did also paint the
      non printable newline characters at the end of each line. This caused
      that with some fonts the newlines where printed with special glyphes.
    * mcc/ExportHook.c: fixed bug #1227680 where the ExportText() method did
      always export one line too much due to not clearing the last 0x0a, which
      in fact is always articial.
    * mcc/HandleInput.c, mcc/Methods.c, mcc/Navigation.c, misc: fixed another
      bunch of problems with hard wrapped lines. There were still some problems
      in correctly selecting a whole hard wrapped line by tripleclicking on it.
      Now TextEditor.mcc should hopefully behave correct with hard wrapped lines
      and display it as correct as it allows to select such lines.
    * mcc/HandleInput.c, mcc/PrintLineWithStyle.c: on a doubleclick on a word
      the editor always marked the block from zero which in fact was a bit
      unintuitive and uncommon compared to other editors. Now if a user double-
      clicks on a word that is e.g. centered only the word is marked.
      In contrast, now also the whole line is drawed marked if the line is
      triple clicked.

2005-06-24  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * mcc/library.c: Only open V36 of layers.library, keymap.library and
      diskfont.library
    * mcc/BlockOperators.c, mcc/EditorStuff.c, mcc/TextEditor-Test.c: Added
      "#include <devices/clipboard.h>" for <libraries/iffparse.h>.
    * mcc/Dispatcher.c, mcc/GetSetAttrs.c, mcc/HandleInput.c: Added
      "#include <intuition/classes.h>" for INST_DATA #define.
    * mcc/private.h: Cleanup #include statements.
    * mcc/AllocBitMap.c: Free allocated bitmap on failure in non-V39 case.
      Move version check into USE_OS3 #define.
      (MUIG_AllocBitMap): Improved friend handling.
    * mcc/AllocFunctions.c: Minor changes.
    * mcc/BlockOperators.c, mcc/Dispatcher.c, mcc/EditorStuff.c, mcc/ExportHook.c,
      mcc/ExportText.c, GetSetAttrs.c, mcc/HandleARexx.c, mcc/HandleInput.c,
      mcc/ImportHook.c, mcc/ImportText.c, mcc/InitConfig.c, mcc/MixedFunctions.c,
      mcc/PrintLineWithStyles.c, mcc/Search.c, mcc/SpellChecker.c,
      mcc/StyleOperators.c: Cleanup #include statements.
    * mcc/SpellChecker.c: Fixed WorkbenchControl() replacement for GCC 3.4.x
      and newer (has to use stdarg.h macros!)
      (CloneSearchPath, FreeSearchPath): Delete >=44 check since thats what
      OpenLibrary() requests.
      (SendRexx, SendCLI): Use LONG as return type.
      (LookupWord, SuggestWord): Update to match SendRexx and SendCLI.

2005-06-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/Navigation.c: fixed a bug in the CursorOffset() function which cures
      the problem with being unable to select the last character of a hard
      wrapped line with the mouse.

2005-06-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcp/KeyStorage.c: improved the extended keycode recognition to also
      recognize NUMLOCK and the newmouse wheel events as well as the
      media keys. So now a user might more intuitively connect commands
      to these extended keycodes as well.

2005-06-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/MixedFunctions.c: fixed bug #1215342 where on hard wrapped lines a
      single character was missing at the end of the wrapped line.
    * mcc/HandleInput.c: applied a patch from Gunther Nikl which removes the
      forbidden floating point math in the wheelmouse scrolling code to due
      our shared library nature.
    * mcc/ImportHook.c: fixed the Plain ImportHook to also call AddGrow for
      every style/color item found instead of combining them. This in fact fixes
      problems with being unable to set text bold on text that was imported.
    * mcc/TextFunctions.c: replaced own anyway slightly buggy TextLength/TextFit
      functions with the OS's own TextLength/TextFit functions and adapted sources
      accordingly.

2005-06-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/ImportHook.c: reworked the MIME/Email based ImportHook to properly
      recognize the ESC sequences like the plain import hook does. This in fact
      seems to be the same behaviour than the old 68k ASM based ImportHooks had.
      Also improved the termination/recognition of the /,*,#,_ chars to make it
      possible to set soft styles on a particular text. This should also fix
      bug #1210745.
    * mcp: added keycodes for the extended keys available in AmigaOS4/MorphOS for
      example. Now keys like PAGE_UP/PAGE_DOWN are properly recognized by the
      preference pane and more intuitively configurable.

2005-06-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/GetSetAttrs.c: if MUIA_Disabled is used on a TextEditor object, an
      existing slider was not automatically disabled as well. bug #1212811

#### v15.12 RELEASE ############################################################

2005-05-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: fixed a crash bug where the InsertHook() was
      using the passed function parameters incorrectly.
    * mcc: fixed bug #1187007 where upon using anti-aliased proportional fonts
      caused the texteditor to not correctly clear the whole cursor areas and
      therefore left some cursor "signs" back in the editor.
    * mcc/Dispatcher.c, mcc/HandleInput.c: fixed bug #1178168 where upon switching
      from another gadget to a texteditor object via the TAB key automatically
      caused that a TAB key is inserted into the text.
    * mcc/HandleInput.c: implemented wheel-mouse event recognition via the rawkey
      based NEWMOUSE standard. Now, each TextEditor.mcc object should allow to
      use an existing wheel-mouse to scroll text up/down. Previously each
      application had to implement that on its own. However, for those apps
      already having implemented it, nothing will change.

2005-05-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * library.c: added missing USE_UTILITYBASE define which in fact was the reason
      why the last two previous releases crashed on OS3 machines. bug #1180094

#### v15.11 RELEASE ############################################################

2005-05-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/TextFunctions.c: with help of the new debugging scheme I was
      finally able to find and fix the reason why under certain circumstances
      a texteditor.mcc gadget could end up in an endless loop if used in write
      mode. This should fix bug #1180094, #1181948.
    * misc: after having finally found a reproduceable case for bug #1180094
      and similar reports, I tight together a complete runtime debugging
      system similar to the one in YAM. It should help in finding this and
      other bugs more easily in future. This new debugging system will search
      for an "texteditor.mcc.debug" ENV variable and does accept similar
      variable content identifies like in YAM. E.g. to pull out all possible
      debug information, compile with -DDEBUG (is the default) and set
      the env variable to "@all all". However, please review the YAM
      ChangeLog for a more detailed description on the debugging scheme.

2005-04-20  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc/Keybinings.c: The default keybindings array has to be
      terminated with a -1. Problem found by Georg Steger.

2005-04-17  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc/Dispatcher.c: Don't add MBQ_MUI_MAXMAX when requesting maximal
      dimension in MUIM_AskMinMax but assign MUI_MAXMAX instead.

2005-04-11  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

    * doc/MCC_TextEditor.guide: general rework - fixed typos and grammar;
      dropped the fancy V40+ formatting to make maintenance easier
      (sorry Allan :o); put the old (<15.10) changes in a separate page;
      documented the historic HD recovery... TODO: installation, arexx,
      credits and more
    * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: no longer highlights the LGPL tidbit (it
      would be unreadable against a white background otherwise, which
      would be quite common for a text editor :); fixed typos and grammar;
      reformatted to be more readable; made the usage and arexx parts
      match what the guide says; added the missing KILLLINE, TOUPPER &
      TOLOWER ARexx commands; no longer refers the user to the AUI
      Style Guide for documentation that belongs to local docs; fixed
      wrong copyright attribution (copyright for the open source code
      begins in 2005, not in 1997)
    * mcc/rev.h, mcp/rev.h: changed copyright mark "(c)" to "(C)" for
      being generally better accepted though still not legally binding
    * doc/MCC_TextEditor.doc: likewise

2005-04-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * includes/mccheader.c: updated common MCC include file to reflect the
      latest changes done in the nlist.mcc project.
    * includes/mccclass_68k: replaced the assembler based OS4/68k stub by an
      easier manageable C-based variant.

2005-04-10  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

    * mcc/library.c: Request rexxsyslib.library V36 (KS 3.1) instead of V38.

#### v15.10 RELEASE ############################################################

2005-04-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * all: last preparations for the 15.10 release. bumped version date and
      such.

2005-04-08  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

    * mcc/SpellChecker.c: Now compiles without OS4 headers too.
    * mcc/TextEditor-Test.c: Fixed MorphOS build.
    * includes/SDI_hook.h: Changed MorphOS hooks to use HookEntry stub.

2005-04-08  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * TODO: Added two more entries (italic letter problem, tabs)

2005-04-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcp/CreatePrefsGroup.c: fixed incorrectly formatted about text.
    * mcp: added missing ENTRY() calls to the Dispatchers which are required
      by the MorphOS build. However, this required to put the Create/Delete
      of our subclasses into Dispatcher.c, but now the mcp should hopefully
      work on MorphOS as well.

2005-04-07  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

    * doc/MCC_TextEditor.doc: fixed typos, corrected grammar, reformatted
      to make it a bit more readable and adapted to the new state of
      affairs (LGPL)

2005-04-07  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc/SpellChecker.c: Reimplemented the search path feature also
      for systems not having a recent workbench.library. Code is mainly
      untested but the core is taken from YAM with permission from
      Jens Langner. So TextEditor-mcc is still LGPL ;)
      Note that this code is not included within the OS4 compile so
      this feature requires at least version 44 of workbench.library
      here. But this is a tautology.
    * mcc: No longer uses static hook declarations within functions,
      because same code of a mcc can be executed by several tasks!
    * doc/MCC_TextEditor.doc: Warn about unpredictable results of
      forbidden placement of some escape sequences for the plain import
      hook.

2005-04-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc: fixed OS3 build as well and removed all remaining compiler
      warnings.
    * mcc/Dispatcher.c: fixed recently broken OS4 build due to latest
      MorphOS changes.

2005-04-06  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

    * mcc: Removed compiler warnings for MorphOS build.

2005-04-06  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc/ImportHook.c: Changed behaviour of FindEOL() not to return NULL
      if the text only consits of a 0 byte. This fixed bug #1177619.

2005-04-05  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc: Clipboard handling for copy/paste was totaly broken (don't
      confuse clipboard.device with console.device ;) ). Now only one
      pointer is used within the instance data for the clipboard io
      request.
    * mcc: Reimplemented Workbench path search support when starting shell
      commands (e.g. for the spell checkers). This however requires at
      least version 44 of workbench.library (coming with OS3.5)
    * mcc: Finished complete reimplementation of the import hooks. Because
      the nature of a reimplementation, the behaviour of the new functions
      might be different and even buggy. Exporting also works in the
      meantime.

2005-04-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/ImportText.c: fixed bug where an empty MUIA_TextEditor_Contents
      string didn't clear the texteditor area.
    * mcc: removed the last bunch of compiler warnings and made the
      custom class compile with -DDEBUG disabled.

2005-04-01  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc: Now clears the area before the text near the cursor is
      redrawn. Fixes bug #1172355 aka "anti alias bug". This is no
      april fool ;)
    * mcc: Started to reimplement all of the import and export hooks
      which were 68k asm before

2005-03-31  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

    * mcc: Fixed buffer overflow which happened if the font name was
      longer than 27 chars.
    * all: Enforce amiga align for the keybinding structure because
      this is exported to the settings file and has to be compatible
      with the 68k version.

2005-03-31  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * all: Source cleanup and minor OS3 makefile changes.

2005-03-31  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcp: modified preferences sources to use flexcat to generate
      the locale.c,h files out of the new TextEditor_mcp.cd and C_?.sd
      files instead of having a static locale interface.

2005-03-31  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

    * mcp/locale/TextEditor_mcp.cd: added

2005-03-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * initial LGPL release published at sf.net
