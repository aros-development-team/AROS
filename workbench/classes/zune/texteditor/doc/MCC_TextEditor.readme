ABOUT TextEditor.mcc
********************

TextEditor.mcc is a multiline string gadget which offers most of the common

- Multi-level undo & redo
- Lines with different alignments (left, right, centered)
- Ability to insert thick or thin separators with an optional title
- Easy marking either using the mouse or keyboard
- Full clipboard support, offering very fast cut & paste routines
- Light text highlighting for e-mail based on an opening ">" character
- Support for external spellcheckers, including type'n'spell and word
  guessing
- Configurable keys, colors, cursor types, blink speed, and much more
- Ability to have a bitmap as a background
- Support for proportional fonts with floating word wrap, as well as
  antialiased fonts
- Pixel smooth scrolling
- AREXX interface for scripted programming

TextEditor is available for AmigaOS3, AmigaOS4, MorphOS and AROS.
