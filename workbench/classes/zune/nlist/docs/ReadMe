ABOUT NList
***********

This is a MUI custom class package containing replacements for the
List/Listtree/Listviews/Floattext/Bitmap/Balance MUI built-in classes.

Horizontal scrolling is fully supported, as well as smooth scrolling,
word wrap, clipboard support, the classic char selection possibility,
drag & drop and many other features. The user can change the column
width with the mouse, and column titles can act as buttons.

A NListviews.mcp prefs class is included, allowing the user to change
backgrounds, pens, fonts, scrollbars mode, drag & drop mode, multiselect
mode, keys, qualifiers and more.

Also included is a Floattext.mui replacement that uses NFloattext.mcc,
enabling copy to clipboard and key moving.

This package includes:

NList.mcc         20.130    17.12.2011
NListview.mcc     19.85     17.12.2011

INSTALLATION
************

1. Extract the archive to a temporary directory:

   > cd RAM:
   > lha x MCC_NList.lha

2. Go to the "MCC_NList/Libs/MUI/<OS>" directory where <OS> is the directory
   matching the operating system you want to install the NList classes for,
   e.g.:

   > cd MCC_NList/Libs/MUI/AmigaOS4

3. Copy all the #?.mcc and #?.mcp files found in that directory to the
   global "MUI:libs/mui/" directory on your system partition.

   > copy #?.mcc MUI:Libs/mui/
   > copy #?.mcp MUI:Libs/mui/

4. Reboot and enjoy the new version ;)
