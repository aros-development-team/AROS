    There are two possible entry-types in a NListtree class list:
    Leaves and nodes. Leaves are simple entries which have no special
    features except they are holding some data. Nodes are almost
    the same type, holding data too, but having a list attached
    where you can simply add other entries which can be again leaves
    or nodes.

    Every node is structured as follows:

        struct MUI_NListtree_TreeNode {

            struct    MinNode    tn_Node;
            STRPTR    tn_Name;
            UWORD    tn_Flags;
            APTR    tn_User;
        };

    It contains a name field tn_Name, flags tn_Flags and a pointer to
    user data tn_User.

    The tn_Flags field can hold the following flags:

        TNF_LIST        The node contains a list where other nodes
                        can be inserted.

        TNF_OPEN        The list node is open, sub nodes are displayed.

        TNF_FROZEN        The node doesn't react on doubleclick or
                        open/close by the user.

        TNF_NOSIGN        The indicator of list nodes isn't shown.

        TNF_SELECTED    The entry is currently selected.

    These flags, except TNF_SELECTED, can be used in
    MUIM_NListtree_Insert at creation time. They will be passed to
    the newly created entry. Also you can do a quick check about the
    state and kind of each entry. But - NEVER EVER - modify any flag
    yourself or NListtree will crash. Be warned!

    *********************************************************************
        THE ABOVE STRUCT IS READ-ONLY!! NEVER CHANGE ANY ENTRY OF THIS
        STRUCTURE DIRECTLY NOR THINK ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF ANY PRIVATE
                        FIELD OR YOU WILL DIE IN HELL!
    *********************************************************************


    You can create very complex tree structures. NListtree only uses
    one list which holds all information needed and has no extra
    display list like other list tree classes ;-)

    The tree nodes can be inserted and removed, sorted, moved, exchanged,
    renamed  or multi  selected.  To sort you can also  drag&drop  them.
    Modifications can be made in relation to the whole tree, to only one
    level, to a sub-tree or to only one tree node.

    The user can control the listtree by the MUI keys, this means a node
    is opened with "Right" and closed with "Left". Check your MUI prefs
    for the specified keys.

    You can define which of the columns will react on double-clicking.
    The node toggles its status from open or closed and vice versa.


    Drag&Drop capabilities:

    If you set MUIA_NList_DragSortable to TRUE, the list tree will
    become active for Drag&Drop. This means you can drag and drop
    entries on the same list tree again. While dragging an indicator
    shows where to drop.

        Drag a    Drop on        Result

        leaf    leaf        Exchange leaves.
        node    leaf        Nothing happens.
        entry    closed node    Move entry, the compare hook is used.
        entry    open node    Move entry to defined position.

    You can not drop an entry on itself, nor can you drop an opened node on
    any of its members.

    To exchange data with other objects, you have to create your own
    subclass of NListtree class and react on the drag methods.

        MUIV_NListtree_Active_LastVisible


   FUNCTION

    Setting this attribute will move the cursor to the defined tree node
    if it is visible. If the node is in an opened tree the listview is
    scrolling into the visible area. Setting MUIV_NListtree_Active_Off will
    vanish the cursor.

    MUIV_NListtree_Active_First/FirstVisible/LastVisible are special values
    for activating the lists first or the top/bottom visible entry.

    See MUIA_NListtree_AutoVisible for special activation features.

    If this attribute is read it returns the active tree node. The result
    is MUIV_NListtree_Active_Off if there is no active entry.


   NOTIFICATIONS

    You can create a notification on MUIA_NListtree_Active. The
    TriggerValue is the active tree node.

        MUIV_NListtree_AutoVisible_Off:
            The display does NOT scroll the active entry into the

        MUIV_NListtree_AutoVisible_Normal:
            This will scroll the active entry into the visible area
            if it is visible (entry is a member of an open node).
            This is the default.

        MUIV_NListtree_AutoVisible_FirstOpen:
            Nodes are not opened, but the first open parent node of
            the active entry is scrolled into the visible area if the
            active entry is not visible.

        MUIV_NListtree_AutoVisible_Expand:
            All parent nodes are opened until the first open node is
            reached and the active entry will be scrolled into the
            visible area.

        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_LeavesBottom


   FUNCTION

    Set this attribute to your own hook if you want to sort the entries in
    the list tree by your own way.

    When you sort your list or parts of your list via MUIM_NListtree_Sort,
    using the insert method with MUIV_NListtree_Insert_Sort or dropping an
    entry on a closed node, this compare hook is called.

    There are some builtin compare hooks available, called:

        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_Head
            Any entry is inserted at head of the list.

        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_Tail
            Any entry is inserted at tail of the list.

        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_LeavesTop
            Leaves are inserted at top of the list, nodes at bottom. They are
            alphabetically sorted.

        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_LeavesMixed
            The entries are only alphabetically sorted.

        MUIV_NListtree_CompareHook_LeavesBottom
            Leaves are inserted at bottom of the list, nodes at top. They are
            alphabetically sorted. This is default.

    The hook will be called with the hook in A0, the object in A2 and
    a MUIP_NListtree_CompareMessage struct in A1 (see nlisttree_mcc.h). You
    should return something like:

        <0    (TreeNode1 <  TreeNode2)
         0    (TreeNode1 == TreeNode2)
        >0    (TreeNode1 >  TreeNode2)

   SPECIAL VALUES

        MUIV_NListtree_ConstructHook_String

        MUIV_NListtree_ConstructHook_Flag_AutoCreate
            If using the KeepStructure feature in MUIM_NListtree_Move or
            MUIM_NListtree_Copy, this flag will be set when calling your
            construct hook. Then you can react if your hook is not simply
            allocating memory.


   FUNCTION

    The construct hook is called whenever you add an entry to your
    listtree. The pointer isn't inserted directly, the construct hook is
    called and its result code is added.

    When an entry shall be removed the corresponding destruct hook is
    called.

    The construct hook will be called with the hook in A0, the object in
    A2 and a MUIP_NListtree_ConstructMessage struct in A1 (see
    nlisttree_mcc.h).
    The message holds a standard kick 3.x memory pool pointer. If you want,
    you can use the exec or amiga.lib functions for allocating memory
    within this pool, but this is only an option.

    If the construct hook returns NULL, nothing will be added to the list.

    There is a builtin construct hook available called
    MUIV_NListtree_ConstructHook_String. This expects that the field
    'tn_User' in the treenode is a string pointer (STRPTR), which's
    string is copied.
    Of course you have to use MUIV_NListtree_DestructHook_String in
    this case!

    To remove the hook set this to NULL.

    NEVER pass a NULL pointer when you have specified the internal string
    construct/destruct hooks or NListtree will die!

        This thing works near like MUIA_NListtree_DisplayHook, but is
        called when the NListtree object want to make a clipboard copy.

        You can return only one string pointer. If you return NULL,
        nothing will be copied. If you return -1, the entry will be
        handled as a normal string and the name field is used.

        between columns.

   SPECIAL VALUES

        MUIV_NListtree_DestructHook_String


   FUNCTION

    Set up a destruct hook for your listtree. The destruct hook is called
    whenevere you remove an entry from the listtree. Here you can free memory
    which was allocated by the construct hook before.

    The destruct hook will be called with the hook in A0, the object
    in A2 and a MUIP_NListtree_DestructMessage struct in A1 (see
    nlisttree_mcc.h).
    The message holds a standard kick 3.x memory pool pointer. You must
    use this pool when you have used it inside the construct hook to
    allocate pooled memory.

    There is a builtin destruct hook available called
    MUIV_NListtree_DestructHook_String. This expects that the 'User' data
    in the treenode is a string and you have used
    MUIV_NListtree_ConstructHook_String in the construct hook!

   NAME

   SPECIAL VALUES


   FUNCTION

    You have to supply a display hook to specify what should be shown in
    the listview, otherwise only the name of the nodes is displayed.

    The display hook will be called with the hook in A0, the object in
    A2 and a MUIP_NListtree_DisplayMessage struct in A1 (see nlisttree_mcc.h)
.

    The structure holds a pointer to a string array containing as many
    entries as your listtree may have columns. You have to fill this
    array with the strings you want to display. Check out that the array
    pointer of the tree column is set to NULL, if the normal name of the
    node should appear.
    You can set a preparse string in Preparse for the corresponding col
    element. Using it you'll be able to avoid copying the string in a
    buffer to add something in the beginning of the col string.

    The display hook also gets the position of the current entry as
    additional parameter. It is stored in the longword preceding the col
    array (don't forget it's a LONG).

    You can set the array pointer of the tree column to a string, which is
    diplayed instead of the node name. You can use this to mark nodes.

    See MUIA_NList_Format for details about column handling.

    To remove the hook and use the internal default display hook set this
    to NULL.

    A doubleclick opens a node if it was closed, it is closed if the node
    was open. You have to set the column which should do this.

    Normally only the column number is set here, but there are special
    values:

        MUIV_NListtree_DoubleClick_Off:
            A doubleclick is not handled.

        MUIV_NListtree_DoubleClick_All:
            All columns react on doubleclick.

        MUIV_NListtree_DoubleClick_Tree
            Only a doubleclick on the defined tree column is recognized.

        MUIV_NListtree_DoubleClick_NoTrigger:
            A doubleclick is not handled and not triggered!


   NOTIFICATION

    The TriggerValue of the notification is the tree node you have double-
    clicked, you can GetAttr() MUIA_NListtree_DoubleClick for the column
    number. The struct 'MUI_NListtree_TreeNode *' is used for trigger.

    The notification is done on leaves and on node columns, which are not
    set in MUIA_NListtree_DoubleClick.

            Search for the complete string, case insensitive.

        MUIV_NListtree_FindUserDataHook_Part
            Search for the first part of the string, case sensitive.

        MUIV_NListtree_FindUserDataHook_PartCaseInsensitive
            Search for the first part of the string, case insensitive.

        MUIV_NListtree_FindUserDataHook_PointerCompare
            Do only a pointer comparision. Note, that this is in fact
            a pointer subtraction to fit into the rules. It returns
            the difference (~0) of the two user fields if no match.


   FUNCTION

    You can install a FindUserData hook to specify your own search
    criteria.

    The find user data hook will be called with the hook in A0, the object
    in A2 and a MUIP_NListtree_FindUserDataMessage struct in A1
    (see nlisttree_mcc.h). It should return ~ 0 for entries which are
    not matching the pattern and a value of 0 if a match.

    The find user data message structure holds a pointer to a string
    containing the data to search for and pointers to the user- and name-
    field of the node which is currently processed.

    MUIV_NListtree_FindUserDataHook_CaseSensitive will be used as
    default.

   SYNOPSIS

    DoMethod(obj, MUIM_NListtree_NextSelected,
        struct MUI_NListtree_TreeNode **treenode);


   FUNCTION

    Iterate through the selected entries of a tree. This method steps
    through the contents of a (multi select) list tree and returns
    every entry that is currently selected. When no entry is selected
    but an entry is active, only the active entry will be returned.

    This behaviour will result in not returning the active entry when
    you have some other selected entries somewhere in your list. Since
    the active entry just acts as some kind of cursor mark, this seems
    to be the only sensible possibility to handle multi selection
    together with keyboard control.


   INPUTS

    treenode -  A pointer to a pointer of struct MUI_NListtree_TreeNode
                that will hold the returned entry. Must be set to
                MUIV_NListtree_NextSelected_Start at start of iteration
                and is set to MUIV_NListtree_NextSelected_End when
                iteration is finished.

        MUIV_NListtree_NextSelected_Start    Set this to start iteration.
        MUIV_NListtree_NextSelected_End        Will be set to this, if
                                            last selected entry reached.

    use 'MUIV_NListtree_Open_ListNode_Parent' to open all its parents, too.

    Only nodes can be opened.


   INPUTS

    listnode -    Specify the node which list is used to open the node.

        MUIV_NListtree_Open_ListNode_Root
            The root list is used.

        MUIV_NListtree_Open_ListNode_Parent
            Indicates, that all the parents of the node specified in
            'treenode' should be opened too.

        MUIV_NListtree_Open_ListNode_Active
            The list of the active node is used.

    treenode -    The node to open.

        MUIV_NListtree_Open_TreeNode_Head
            Opens the head node of the list.

        MUIV_NListtree_Open_TreeNode_Tail
            Opens the tail node of the list.

        MUIV_NListtree_Open_TreeNode_Active
            The active node will be opened.

        MUIV_NListtree_Open_TreeNode_All:
            All the nodes of the list are opened.


   RESULT

   EXAMPLE
        // Open the active list.

   NAME

    MUIM_NListtree_PrevSelected -- Get previous selected tree node. (V1)


   SYNOPSIS

    DoMethod(obj, MUIM_NListtree_PrevSelected,
        struct MUI_NListtree_TreeNode **treenode);


   FUNCTION

    Iterate reverse through the selected entries of a tree. This method
    steps through the contents of a (multi select) list tree and returns
    every entry that is currently selected. When no entry is selected
    but an entry is active, only the active entry will be returned.

    This behaviour will result in not returning the active entry when
    you have some other selected entries somewhere in your list. Since
    the active entry just acts as some kind of cursor mark, this seems
    to be the only sensible possibility to handle multi selection
    together with keyboard control.


   INPUTS

    treenode -  A pointer to a pointer of struct MUI_NListtree_TreeNode
                that will hold the returned entry. Must be set to
                MUIV_NListtree_PrevSelected_Start at start of iteration
                an the end and is set to MUIV_NListtree_PrevSelected_End
                when first selected entry is reached and iteration is
                finished.

        MUIV_NListtree_PrevSelected_Start    Set this to start iteration.
        MUIV_NListtree_PrevSelected_End        Will be set to this, if
                                            last selected entry reached.


   RESULT

   EXAMPLE

    // Iterate through a list (reverse)
    struct MUI_NListtree_TreeNode *treenode;

    treenode = MUIV_NListtree_PrevSelected_Start;

    for (;;)
    {
        DoMethod(listtree, MUIM_NListtree_PrevSelected, &treenode);

        if (treenode==MUIV_NListtree_PrevSelected_End)
            break;

        printf("selected: %s\n", treenode->tn_Name);

            Adding this flag to seltype forces the selection by
            bypassing the multi test hook.

    state -        Pointer to a longword. If not NULL, it will be filled
                with the current selection state of the entry.


   RESULT

   EXAMPLE

        // cancel our selection.
        if (retstate == MUIV_NListtree_Select_On) {
            ...
        }


   NOTES

    If ( treenode == MUIV_NListtree_Select_All ) and
    ( seltype == MUIV_NListtree_Select_Ask ), state will be filled
    with the total number of selected entries.

    NEW for final 18.6:
    If (treenode == MUIV_NListtree_Select_Active ) and
    ( seltype == MUIV_NListtree_Select_Ask ), state will be the
    active entry, if any, or NULL.

    If only the active entry is selected, has a cursor mark (see
    MUIM_NListtree_NextSelected for that), you will receive 0 as
    the number of selected entries.
