    This MCC public custom class is derived from the MUI standard
    balance class which handles the dragging/resizing of vertical and
    horizontal groups.

    In contrast to the standard MUI balance class, however, it adds
    some features such as displaying a mouse pointer as soon as the
    mouse is above a dragable NBalance object.

    It is released and distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License (LGPL) and available free of charge.

    *******************************************************************

NBalance.mcc is able to save the balancing weights permanently. Just set a
unique MUIA_ObjectID and use MUIM_Application_Load/Save to permanently load
or save the current balancing weights.
