    This MCC public custom class is derived from the MUI standard
    balance class which handles the dragging/resizing of vertical and
    horizontal groups.

    In contrast to the standard MUI balance class, however, it adds
    some features such as displaying a mouse pointer as soon as the
    mouse is above a dragable NBalance object.
