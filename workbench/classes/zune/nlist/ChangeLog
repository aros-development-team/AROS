#### v0.116 RELEASE ###########################################################

2013-04-25 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.116 release preparations
  * include/muiextra.h: added definition of MUII_PopFont as some MUI SDK might
    not have them yet.

2013-04-24 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/greek.ct, nlistviews_mcp/locale/greek.ct: updated greek
    translation kindly provided by Antonis Iliakis.

2013-04-22 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/NListviews.c: use the font popup button image for MUI 3.9+.

2013-04-16 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/locale/german.ct: fixed a typo.

2013-04-03 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: (re)adding the vertical scrollbar will trigger
    the just installed notifications immediately. This solves the problem that
    the scrollbar would have the wrong dimension in case the list's number of
    total and visible entries has changed in the meantime (i.e. when switching
    folders in YAM).

2013-03-25 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c: added a missing NULL pointer check for an allocation.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c: fixed two possible buffer underruns in case even the
    replacement sequence "..." was too long.
  * nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: remove all added notifications when removing one
    of the scrollbars. Otherwise the notification list will constantly grow upon
    each readding and removing of a scrollbar object and therefore will make
    notifications slower and slower.

2013-03-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/mccinit.c, include/shellstart.c: rearranged the code to ensure that
    trying to start the final class from a shell does not crash.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc0.c: abort any actions caused by a pressed left mouse
    button whenever the object receives the MUIM_GoInactive method. This fixes
    the issue described in YAM ticket #391: http://yam.ch/ticket/391
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: don't "eat" IDCMP_(IN)ACTIVEWINDOW messages as other
    objects might be interested in these as well. Having multiple NList objects
    in one window should allow each of these to react on these IDCMP messages.

2013-03-05 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func2.c: fixed MUIM_NList_SetActive when used with a flags
    value of MUIV_NList_SetActive_Entry. Before the search for the given entry
    was always failing.

2013-01-31 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: made the return value of MUIM_NList_GetPos consistent
    by be TRUE if and only if the given entry could be found in the list. For all
    other cases the position will be set to MUIV_NList_GetPos_End and FALSE will
    be returned.

2013-01-29 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: pay attention to the possibly unsafe killing of
    MUI notifies by doing an artificial OM_SET right after the kill to ensure
    that Notify.mui has removed the killed notifies before another nested OM_SET
    might happen.

2013-01-28 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: replaced all handcrafted flag checks and flag
    modifications our typical flag macros.

2013-01-26 Samir Hawamdeh <s.hawamdeh@tin.it>

  * nlistviews_mcp/locale/italian.ct, nlisttree_mcp/locale/italian.ct:
    update italian translation.

2013-01-11 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistview_mcc/NListview.c, nlistviews_mcp/NListviews.c: enabling "on demand"
    scrollbars is from now on forbidden in case an unsafe MUI version is found.
    This affects MUI 3.8 in general and older versions of MUI 3.9 and MUI4. The
    reason is that adding or removing the scrollbars on demand involves adding or
    removing of notifies which is broken in older MUI versions if this happens
    in nested OM_SET method calls. Since NList cannot know the global situation
    in which it is instructed to add/remove its scrollbars and since this issue
    can only be fixed in MUI itself we decided to disable this feature for the
    affected MUI version to avoid nasty things like double freed memory (my MUI!)
    to happen. MUI 3.9 and MUI4 for AmigaOS4 have been fixed in the meantime and
    the MorphOS team has been informed how to fix this issue.

2013-01-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbalance_mcc/Pointer.c, nlist_mcc/Pointer.c: use the column and row resize
    pointer types instead of simple arrow images and bumped minimum version of
    intuition.library to 53.41 (AmigaOS4 only).

#### v0.115 RELEASE ###########################################################

2012-12-22 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.115 release preparations

2012-12-22 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * tools/mkrelease: add italian catalog to the release archive.
  * nbalance_mcc/NBalance.c: check the saved and loaded weight values to be
    non-zero. Otherwise the GUI might become unresizable. Thanks to Christoph
    Pölzl for the hint.

#### v0.114 RELEASE ###########################################################

2012-12-20 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.114 release preparations

2012-11-19 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbalance_mcc/Pointer.c, nlist_mcc/Pointer.c: make use of the standard mouse
    pointer images in the AmigaOS4 build if intuition.library 53.37 is
    available.

2012-11-12 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbalance_mcc/Dispatcher.c, nbalance_mcc/NBalance.c: implemented MUIM_Export
    and MUIM_Import to save/load the surrounding group's balancing weights as
    known from classes like BetterBalance.mcc.

2012-10-11 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/locale/italian.ct, nlisttree_mcp/locale/italian.ct: added
    italian translation kindly provided by Samir Hawamdeh.

2012-09-21 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/NListviews.c: fixed the brain dead approach to save 32bit
    values with 8 bytes.
  * nlistviews_mcp/NListviews.c: save string variables with their current length
    instead of their maximum length.
  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: save string variables with their current length
    instead of their maximum length.

2012-08-28 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c, nlistviews_mcp/NListviews.c: adjusted the crawling
    text to better match the capabilities of Crawling.mcc.

2012-08-07 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: replaced all AllocVec() calls by AllocVecTags() for the AmigaOS4 build.
    Also replaced all remaining AllocMem() calls by AllocVec(Tags)().

#### v0.113 RELEASE ###########################################################

2012-08-06 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.113 release preparations

2012-06-19 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: don't allocate locked memory.

2012-06-13 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc1.c: fixed the screwed up display
    in case MUII_WindowBack was set as background image and the list had a title.
    This closes BZ #7873.

2012-05-16  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlistviews_mcp/locale/swedish.ct: updated according to changes.

2012-05-15 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbalance_mcc/private.h: changed the _isinobject() macro to accept the
    complete object's area and not just the inner space to match the active area
    of Balance.mui's quite mode.

2012-05-14 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/Makefile: removed .catalog files in clean target.

#### v0.112 RELEASE ###########################################################

2012-05-12 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.112 release preparations
  * nlist_mcc/Makefile, nlistview_mcc/Makefile: restored the -DNO_INLINE_STDARG
    define in CFLAGS as otherwise our AROS cross-compilers won't build for these
    targets and raise some "untermated macro" errors when building our test
    applications.

2012-05-02 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_grp.c: the MUIM_AskMinMax method must not overwrite the sizes
    returned by the superclass but add the own dimensions instead. This fixes the
    spurious layout issues in conjunction with YAM.

2012-04-17 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc1.c: don't handle background specs
    like MUII_#? as strings.

2012-04-13 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/locale/german.ct: fixed a typo.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c: cleaned up font name generation.

2012-04-13 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func2.c: fixed bug where a sort operation of a single item
    via drag&drop ended up moving the item to the wrong position if the item was
    moved down (up worked).

2012-04-07 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * Makefiles: removed -funroll-loops as that is potentially dangerous.

2012-04-02 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c: added missing release of inactive pen.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc1.c: string pointers obtained
    from the MUI configuration must be copied instead of rembembered directly.
    With MUI4's realtime prefs the pointer might become invalid at any time and
    hence the class would operate on invalid data after that.

2012-03-28 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/locale: fixed a typo in the built in english strings.

2012-01-29 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * misc: backport of AROS fixes.

2011-12-24  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/swedish.ct, nlistviews_mcp/locale/swedish.ct:
    updated according to changes.

#### v0.111 RELEASE ###########################################################

2011-12-17 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.111 release preparations

2011-12-15 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistree_mcc/NListtree.c: fixed a NULL pointer access when invoking the
    MUIM_NListtree_CopyToClip method when no tree entry is selected.

2011-12-15 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c: reimplemented the new PartialColumn text substitution
    feature where "..." is showing in a column rather than showing some dotted line
    at the end of the column if text doesn't fit. Now the text substitution area can
    be specified in MUIA_NList_Format via PCS_LEFT/PCS_RIGHT/PCS_CENTER/PCS_DISABLED.
    So application developers can now specify the text alignment by using these
    format specs. NList will then replace not fitting text with "..." characters
    to signal that text was stripped. Please note, however, that this feature is
    still not being perfect and there might be situation where the "..." text might
    be added at the wrong position (e.g. if different font styles/objects are using
    in one column).

2011-08-03 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Makefile: added definition of __amigaos3__ for all classes for the OS3
    build to make OS3 specific stuff easier to implement.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc3.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c: fixed offsets when drawing
    the background image for the upcoming MUI 3.9 of AmigaOS 4.1 update #3.

2011-07-14 Mariusz Danilewicz <mandi@interia.pl>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/polish.ct: update to the latest changes.

2011-07-12 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/nlisttree_mcp: now that NList allows to define zero sized
    objects we could remove the IndentWidth > 3 enforcement and make NListtree
    allow IndentWidths down till 0. However, we do have to enforce that the correct
    NList version is installed or the NListtree layout is screwed up. Furthermore,
    renamed the "Indent width" to "Additional indent width" as that better
    describes what this is all about. In addition, the new default for the
    indent width is zero as that ensures a small NListtree object.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc4.c: now objects defined with \033O and \033I can have a
    minimal width of 0. Previously NList always enforced a minimum of 2 which
    caused some pixel alignment problems with e.g. NListtree.

2011-07-11 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale: updated german and english-british translations.
  * nlisttree_mc[cp]: renamed the "dashed" mode to "dotted", as this is more
    appropriate.

2011-07-10 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp: forgot to add the new LineType and UseFolderImage config items
    to the dataspace. Thus they were never queried by applications using NListtree.mcc.
  * nlisttree_mcc, nlisttree_mcp: completly reworked the preferences setup and got
    rid of the way NListtree allows to use different "Styles". This was not only
    partly nonsense, but was also not completely consistently implemented. Now every
    parameter of the previously allowed style parameters can be configured
    separately in the MCP. In addition, tree display and how the different parameters
    are use should be way more consistent. Also drawing the tree should be more
    pixel accurate than before and produce the same layout no matter which line
    type is selected in the preferences. In addition, new sensible default parameters
    are now in place which should give everyone a nice lookin default tree with
    the possibility to tune everything on their own will. Some fine tuning might
    still be required to get everything more smoothly implemented, but the whole
    tree display and management should be way more consistent and intuitive.

2011-07-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * demo/NList-Demo.c, demo/NListtree-Demo.c: added list of used classes.

2011-07-03 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: changed default imagespec settings to use 6:XXX rather
    than 1:XXX. This should automatically chose the right image per default based on
    the global settings.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c: we now add "..." to the end of a string if it doesn't
    fit in a column and was stripped accordingly. This should make it more obvious
    for the user that there is more to read if he is going to enlarge the column.

2011-05-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/libraries/mui.h: removed the AROS-only STACKED keywords which are
    not needed at all, since AROS has its own header file.
  * include/mui/NList_mcc.h: added definition of SIPTR for non-AROS systems.
  * misc: fixed various (S)IPTR related warnings due to the latest AROS specific
    changes.

2011-04-19 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * misc: backport of AROS fixes.

#### v0.110 RELEASE ###########################################################

2011-04-17 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.110 release preparations

2011-02-22 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: MUIM_NList_GetEntry tries to avoid a possible NULL
    pointer access in case no valid pointer to store the entry is given. The
    entry pointer itself is returned as the methods return value in any case.
    This matches the behavior of List.mui.
  * nfloattext_mcc/NFloattext.c, nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: removed an unused
    macro.

2011-02-17 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func2.c: try to move around entries only if there is really
    anything to move.
  * nlist_mcc/Debug.c: implemented the STARTCLOCK() and STOPCLOCK() functions to
    be able to measure real execution times.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c: set the entry pool's threshold size to the same value
    as the puddle size for the non-OS4 builds. This improves freeing items from
    the pool a lot.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_func2.c: removed a duplicate setActive() call without any
    effect.

2011-02-07 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func4.c: readded the pen number check which accidentally got
    removed during the recent code cleanup and caused bodychunk object to be not
    displayed anymore, because their color depth was calculated as zero. This
    closes bug #317905.

2011-02-05 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale, nlistviews_mcp/locale: added turkish catalog
    translation kindly provided by Alper Sönmez.

2011-02-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * all/Makefile: fixed the dependency generation to respect the system specific
    object file path.

#### v0.109 RELEASE ###########################################################

2011-02-03 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.109 release preparations

2011-01-03 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: fixed a very strange isse which occured when a used
    clicked inside a list while the window had MUIA_Window_Sleep set to TRUE. In
    this case the click seemed to be cached and be applied again as soon as the
    window was woken up again, which is definitely wrong.
    It remains to be seen if this change causes any new funny things.
    Thanks to Andreas Falkenhahn for the hint!

2011-01-02 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc5.c: removed a double check for a pending entry click
    notification.

2010-12-20 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: removed an unneeded function.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc5.c: use the class pointer obtained during OM_NEW instead
    of getting it each time anew.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c: got rid of some V37 graphics.library bug workarounds.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc4.c: got rid of some V37 intuition.library limitations.
  * include/mccinit.c, #?/library.c: raised the minimum required system version
    to OS3.0.

2010-12-18 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: use Exec functions to navigate within a list on
    AmigaOS4 and AROS.
  * nlist_mcc/misc: removed some OS2.x compatibility code.
  * nbalance_mcc/misc: removed some OS2.x compatibility code.

2010-12-16 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/all: LOTS of code clean up. For some very obscure reason Gilles
    decided to pass a pointer to the object and its instance data to all called
    functions, although the instance data already carry a pointer to the object
    and many deeply nested function don't need the object pointer at all. This
    caused lots of stack space to be wasted for no good reason and made NList
    much slower than necessary due to the additional overhead of passing unused
    parameters.

2010-12-10 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: implemented construct, destruct, compare and
    display methods which can be overloaded by subclasses. These methods fall
    back to the corresponding old hooks in case they are not overloaded. Also
    removed some parameters being passed separately although they are globally
    available through the instance data which is passed as well and there are
    no alternatives to affected the parameters.
  * nlist_mcc/misc: heavily cleaned up the memory management by removing all the
    wrapper functions and using Alloc/FreeVecPooled directly. For the 68k build
    appropriate reimplementations have been added which are still compatible
    with OS2.x. This saves lots of additional jumps and passing of unused
    parameters.
  * nlist_mcc/misc: added a second size optimized pool for the single entries.
    For the AmigaOS4 build this is an item pool, for all other builds a pool
    with appropriate puddle and threshold sizes is used. This should speed up
    entry handling a bit more.
  * nlist/misc: dropped custom memory pool implementation. This means that OS2.x
    is no longer supported and OS3.0 is the absolute minimum. But then, who does
    really still use OS2.x with a monster like NList?

2010-12-09 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: replaced the NList display hook by a method. This
    requires at least NList 20.127.
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: the version of NList.mcc is now queried directly
    instead of the previous indirect method.

2010-11-16 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: redraw the background only if we are told to be a
    button. Otherwise the truecolor .mcp images will not be drawn correctly.
  * nbitmap_mcc/SetPatch.c: replaced the version check of graphics.library by a
    more appropriate check of the installed SetPatch command.

2010-11-15 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/Chunky2Bitmap.c: don't use WritePixelLine8() on plain OS3.1
    systems, as this function is broken there and may trash memory.
  * demo/NBitmap-Demo.c: added some error messages in case something went wrong.

2010-10-05 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: make sure that removing the library during LibClose()
    really operates on the correct base. Calling LibExpunge() on MorphOS is
    wrong, since that takes no parameter but expects the base to be in A6. We
    work around this by using an additional function which gets called from
    LibClose() and LibExpunge() with the correct base pointer.

2010-10-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func2.c: fixed another wrong handling of the special value
    MUIV_NList_Move_Next.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_func2.c, nlist_mcc/move.c: fixed the wrong behaviour of
    MUIM_NList_Move. The destination position was always decremented and the
    item was moved to the position ahead of the inteded one. Now NList behaves
    exactly like List.mui again. Thanks to Andread Falkenhahn for the hint.

#### v0.108 RELEASE ###########################################################

2010-09-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.108 release preparations

2010-09-18  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/swedish.ct, nlistviews_mcp/locale/swedish.ct:
    new file generated by FlexCat 2.7.

2010-09-15 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc: the chunky->bitmap conversion needed for systems using either
    native graphics or CyberGraphics is now done using WritePixelLine8() instead
    of WritePixelArray() or our own reimplementation. The WPA() reimplementation
    also uses WPL8() instead of the dead slow SetAPen/WritePixel combo.

2010-09-14 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/misc: fixed lots of bugs when having to dither raw truecolor
    images for a colormapped screen. Additionally the background is now drawn
    correctly in case a pattern is used.

2010-09-10 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * tools/mkrelease.sh: split up the catalog copying due to the different
    translations available.
  * nlisttree_mcp/Makefile: removed the utterly outdated russian translation
    until it is updated again.

2010-09-09 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c: removed the globally cached muiRenderInfo pointer.
    The pointer is now obtained whenever it is needed.

2010-09-08 Mariusz Danilewicz <mandi@interia.pl>

  * AUTHORS: added translators section (please check and update missing persons).

2010-09-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mccinit.c: added missing #include <string.h> for memset().

2010-09-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc4.c: fixed a serious issue when an application wanted to
    override the MUIM_NList_Display method. The supplied preparses pointer was
    completely wrong and using it caused instant crashes. The internal fallback
    to one of the hook functions worked only because NList's internal display
    function never used the pointers, but relied on its private knowledge about
    the source of the pointers. I can't believe no developer complained about
    this bug before!

2010-09-03 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mccinit.c, #?/ClipboardServer.c: updated to the latest version and clear all
    embedded semaphore structures before calling InitSemaphore().
  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap-Test.c: don't require cybergraphics.library to be avail-
    able since everything should work without it.
  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap-Test.c: close the libraries in exact reverse open order.

2010-09-02 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: fixed the definition of DoSuperNew() for all builds except MorphOS.

2010-09-01 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: replaced the last occurences of WritePixelArray() by
    the WPA() macro which is aware of the minimum required version of CGX.
  * nbitmap_mcc/WritePixelArray.c: added missing increase of source pointer.
  * nbitmap_mcc/DitherImage.c: clear the mask bitmap, otherwise we will get
    trashed graphics.
  * nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: if the HandleEvent or HandleInput methods must be
    forwarded to the embedded NList object the methods' return code is now
    correctly returned to MUI itself. This fixes ticket #200 of YAM.
  * nbitmap_mcc/WritePixelArray.c, nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: added a quite dumb but
    working reimplementation of WritePixelArray() for OS3 systems without CGX or
    P96. This fixes bug #3057361.
  * nbitmap_mcc/WritePixelArrayAlpha.c: fixed the final image calculation by
    combining the correct RGB values. This makes it possible to correctly
    display alpha blended images even with V42 CGX/OS3 systems.

2010-08-31 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc: changed the DitherImageA() function to have 2 arguments rather than
    a single one. This allowed to get rid of the SLOWSTACK stuff in DitherImage()
    and thus have a single unified function.
  * misc: checked all varargs function to not use the SLOWSTACK stuff on AROS
    as this might be the reason for our recent problems with NList and AROS. With
    the SDI stdarg macros all this SLOWSTACK stuff does not seem to be required
    anymore.

2010-08-31 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: readded the custom implementation of
    WritePixelArrayAlpha() for OS3 systems which don't have this function yet.
    The alpha channel calculation is not yet perfect, but it works. This fixes
    bug #3055632 of TextEditor.mcc.

2010-08-30 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/DitherImage.c: allocate chip RAM for the dithered images
    instead of any RAM. This should fix display problems on systems with native
    chipset.

2010-08-30 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: unified all DoSuperNew() methods to be static and to use the VA_LIST
    macros defined in SDI_stdarg.h rather than using the SLOWSTACK stuff on AROS.
  * misc: changed all makefiles to use -O2 for the optimization level for AROS
    compiles. This should hopefully fix the crashes with the latest versions
    released. It seems something prevents to compile NList with -O3 on AROS.
  * misc: fixed some AROS related compiler warnings

2010-08-29 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp,NListviews_mcp.h: changed the default keybindings to select
    entries in the listview with the ALT key rather than the CONTROL key because
    the default MUI keybindings are already using the CONTROL key for scrolling
    up/down thus clashes with the default NList settings.

2010-08-27 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: added a similar workaround as for NListview.mcc
    for MUI 3.8. The tree object must let the superclass handle certain key
    presses.
  * nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: added a workaround for MUI 3.8. The embedded list
    object does not get the MUIM_HandleEvent method, we must forward it ourself.
    This is no issue with MUI 3.9+.

2010-08-24 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * mmakefile.src: changes of the AROS build system required some fixes

#### v0.107 RELEASE ###########################################################

2010-08-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.107 release preparations

2010-08-17 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: raised the eventhandler's priority to 2. This
    fixes the double click issue to open closed nodes.

#### v0.106 RELEASE ###########################################################

2010-08-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.106 release preparations

2010-08-16 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c: raised the eventhandler's priority to +1. This solves
    the problem that the NList object was no longer getting key presses as soon
    as a horizontal scrollbar was added due a resized window.

2010-08-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: implemented new MUIM_NList_SetActive method which will replace
    the old method of setting an entry active via MUIA_NList_Active. The new
    method allows to set the entry active and make it immediately visible via
    an internal call to MUIM_NList_Jump. In addition this method allows to
    set additional flags and should perform a bit faster instead of executing
    a MUIA_NList_Active call together with a Jump call.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: moved the functionality of MUIM_NList_Jump into an
    own static function NL_List_Jump() and made NL_List_Active() also utilizing
    this new function for jumping to the right entry to make it visible.

2010-08-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: replaced the recently added global MUIA_NList_CenterOnJump
    attribute with an additional MUIV_NList_Jump_Active_Center value that can
    be supplied to the MUIM_NList_Jump method to perform a centered jump for
    the currently active entry. This should be a bit more convienent than having
    to set a global attribute.

2010-07-30 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc: added new attribute MUIA_NList_CenterOnJump to make the method
    MUIM_NList_Jump not just jump to the given entry but also center the display
    on that entry.
  * nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: moved some inlined code to separate functions.
  * nlist_mcc: the parent NListview object is now determined during MUIM_Setup
    to correctly fulfil the "active object on click" feature due to the latest
    changes.
  * nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: forward any modifications of the key focus
    attributes to the NList object.
  * docs/MCC_NList.doc: added documentation for new MUIA_NList_CenterOnJump
    attribute.

2010-07-29 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/misc, nlistview_mcc/misc: made the two attributes
    MUIA_NList_Active/DefaultObjectOnClick get()able to let the surrounding
    NListview object derive the "active border visible" from the embedded list
    object.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: the "active object on click" feature must set the
    surrounding listview as active object instead of itself.
  * doc/MCC_NList.doc: updated Autodocs according to latest changes.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: "moved" the centering of the active entry to the
    MUIM_NList_Jump method.

2010-07-08 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: setting the active entry will now try to show the
    entry centered within the visible lines if it was outside before. Further-
    more NList will ensure that the last item is shown on the last line (no
    empty space below the last line).
  * all/Debug.c: added CleanupDebug() function needed by the latest mccinit.c.

2010-06-29 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/locale/swedish.ct: added ##codeset line.

2010-06-25 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: the custom pointers will be shown only if the mouse
    is over the respective object instead of just being over the list's window.
    Although I could not reproduce the effect with AmigaOS3 this should fix the
    problems on MorphOS.

2010-06-11 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Install-MCC: extended the final message that a reboot might be necessary to
    be able to use the just installed version.

2010-06-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/SDI_compiler.h: updated to latest version.
  * misc: added lots of type casts due to latest AROS changes.

2010-06-06 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/private.h: fixed definition of types. You can't assume that
    "long" is 32 bit on all systems.
  * demo/NBitmap-Demo.c: wrong type caused corrupt images on 64-bit AROS.
  * mmakefile.src: fixed copying of png.icon
  * some warnings removed, some TODO comments added.

2010-06-05 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * mmakefile.src: updated to recent changes
  * mccinit.c: updated to current version
  * some fixes for 64-bit AROS (ULONG -> IPTR)

2010-05-28 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc: cleaned up the config import and export functions.

2010-05-27 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * dist/Install-MCC: the supported languages are now collected dynamically
    instead of being defined statically. Furthermore the .mcc name must be
    specified in the script's icon as application name. This makes it possible
    to use the script for arbitrary classes without modification.
  * dist/icons: set some reasonable default icon positions.
  * nlist_mcc: removed the permanent copy of the exported stuff as this is not
    needed at all outside the export function.

2010-05-26 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * dist/Install-MCC: added the first version of a generic MCC Installer script.
    To use this script for other classes only the name and the set of supported
    languages needs to be adapted.

2010-05-20 Mariusz Danilewicz <mandi@interia.pl>

  * ChangeLog: updated - missed last time.

2010-05-20 Mariusz Danilewicz <mandi@interia.pl>

  * nlistviews_mcp\locale\NListviews_mcp.cd: fixed typo in
    MSG_FUNC_DEFALLORDERCOL and updated (c) notice in MSG_EXAMPLE_TEXT
  * nlistviews_mcp\locale\polish.ct: added Polish translation
  * nlisttree_mcp\locale\polish.ct: added Polish translation
  * tools\mkrelease.sh: added generating Polish catalog to release
  * nlistviews_mcp\makefile and mmakefile.src: added generating Polish catalog
  * nlisttree_mcp\makefile and mmakefile.src: added generating Polish catalog

2010-05-20 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Makefiles: add varargs stubs only for those systems which really need it.

2010-05-19 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * demo/NBitmap-Demo.c: replaced the old and complete broken demo application
    by our stripped down test application. A few bells and whistles less than
    the former demo application, but at least it works without problems and
    shows the new handling of raw image data.
  * added stuff for automated build of release archives.

#### v0.105 RELEASE ###########################################################

2010-05-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.105 release preparations

2010-05-11 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/mui/NList_mcc.h: added a comment to skip certain method IDs for
    future extensions to avoid clashes with other classes.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c: use GetBitMapAttr() to determine a bitmap's depth
    of V39+ systems instead of peeking around.
  * nlist_mcc: replaced custom stpcpy() function by uses of then overrun-save
    functions strlcpy() and snprintf().
  * nlist_mcc: removed now unused function ltoa().

2010-05-07 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: clicks on the list's border are no longer taken as
    valid clicks within the list. Before such clicks resulted in the first/last
    entry to be selected, which is not very intuitive. This fixes bug #2951808.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc4.c: simplified the image spec handling. Specifying
    additional dimensions was discouraged anyway and the old scanning  algorithm
    completely broke the color handling. Effectively this fixes bug #1272693.
  * doc/MCC_NList.doc: updated documentation about direct "ESC I[<s>]" image
    specs. Only image specs followings the rules are supported from now on.

2010-05-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c: the class will now forget that its MUIM_Setup method
    has been invoked before deleting possibly added list images. Otherwise the
    surrounding group would be told to perform a relayout, which is not a very
    good thing to do while everything is being cleaned up. This fixes bug
    #2977811.

2010-05-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: fixed slightly broken handling of RGB24 data.
    Additionally the required bitmap for transparent colormapped blits with
    CyberGraphics is now created once instead of on every redraw.

2010-05-03 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc: implemented a simple dithering to be able to display truecolor
    images on colormapped screens. A fixed but colorful palette will be used.

#### v0.104 RELEASE ###########################################################

2010-04-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.104 release preparations
  * include/libraries/mui.h: added MORPHOS #ifdef to maskout the Rawimage
    definition.

2010-04-30 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/library.c: added version check for NBitmap.mcc. Only version V15.8+ can
    handle raw image data.

2010-04-29  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc: unified the draw image routines of the raw data and dtobject
    functionality so that the raw data can be used equivalently to the file
    or dtobject based functionality. However, somehow this new functionality
    have to be slightly tested before we can really roll it out. Especially
    the shape drawing part have to be evaluated if this still work with raw
    data as well.

2010-04-29 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/dispatcher.c: let OM_NEW fail if no valid type is specified.

2010-04-28 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/misc: added some new attributes to handle raw image data.

2010-04-27 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/library: all systems now try to create a truecolor prefs image using
    Rawimage.mcc first before falling back to the old 8bit images.

2010-04-26 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/misc: merged all converted image data into one file, moved the image
    files to a separate subdirectory, combined the prefs icon generation for
    all platform into one function.

2010-04-24 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest version. This fixes the stack swapping
    for AROS.

2010-04-23 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@yahoo.com>

  * mcp/misc: use bzip2 compressed 32bit prefs image on MorphOS 2.

2010-04-12 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mcp/misc: added 32bit truecolor prefs image done by Martin 'Mason' Merz.
    This requires at least MUI3.9 and AmigaOS 4.1.

2010-03-13 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: added another check if compositing is really
    enabled on the object's screen.

2010-03-11 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: finally it is possible to automatically open
    closed nodes during drag'n'drop sessions by simply dragging an object over
    a closed node and wait there for at least one second. Since opening the
    node might cause bigger graphical updates on the screen this feature
    requires a non-locked screen. That means that for example LockLayers()
    must *NOT* have been called before. Currently this is only the fact with
    the yet unreleased next MUI3.9 for OS4 and only on hi/truecolor screens.

2010-01-08 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: reverted the last change as it didn't really
    work out and still caused some issues with dynamically added scrollbars.

2010-01-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: added a workaround to the layout issue when the
    dynamically added/removed scrollbars caused a screwed up layout with objects
    drawn over the window borders. Also cleaned up the source a lot.
  * nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: cleaned up the code even more. Now all added
    notifications are removed again when the scrollbars are removed from the
    layout.

2010-01-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/private.h: added missing rawkey definitions for PageUp, PageDown,
    Pos1 and End keys. OS3 doesn't know these.

2009-12-30 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: the PageUp, PageDown, Pos1 and End keys can now be
    used to navigate within a list in addition to the standard MUI keys.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: simplified the code keyboard scrolling code a bit.

2009-11-28 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/ClipboardServer.c, nlisttree_mcc/ClipboardServer.c: decreased the
    stack size from 16K to 8K as the server process doesn't really need much
    stack.

2009-10-28 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/Debug.c: added the missing DBF_CLIPBOARD class.

2009-10-26 Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlistviews_mcp/locale/swedish.ct: very minor update.

#### v0.103 RELEASE ###########################################################

2009-10-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.103 release preparations

2009-10-15 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.h: replaced the custom style definitions by official
    ones.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_func2.c, docs/MCC_NList.doc: MUIM_NList_ReplaceSingle was
    broken in several ways. Passing pos==MUIV_NList_Insert_Bottom did nothing
    instead of replacing the last entry, pos==MUIV_NList_Insert_Active chose
    the correct entry, but due to a missing "break;" statement that entry was
    discarded again and caused no replacement at all. Again thanks to Andreas
    Falkenhahn for the hint.
  * demo/NList-Demo#?.c: removed some unneeded includes.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc1.c: get()ting MUIA_Disabled always returned FALSE even
    for disabled lists. Thanks to Andreas Falkenhahn for the hint.

2009-09-19 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: added a name to all memory pools for OS4.

2009-09-17 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/locale/german.ct, nlistviews_mcp/Makefile: added a german
    translation.
  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/german.ct: replaced the former german translation with
    a completely new one.

2009-09-16 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/misc: loaded all clipboard access stuff off to a separate process.
    Accessing the clipboard via iffparse.library requires 2 user signals for
    each instance and thus an application would run out of free signals sooner
    or later.
  * nlisttree_mcc/misc: applied the same changes as for NList.mcc and clipboard
    access.

2009-08-14 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Makefiles: added "-g" to the debug flags. It seems the OS3 GCC 2.95.3 cross
    compiler needs this to generate debug infos at all.

2009-06-16 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: added some APTR typecasts to fix several type pun
    warnings.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: replaced the hand crafted message for the embedded
    DoMethodA() call by a proper structure. This fixes a type pun warning.

2009-06-15 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * Renamed francais.ct to french.ct, so that we have only English language names.
  * Added catalog creation to AROS metamakefiles
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: check variable "ln" to avoid a segfault.
    This happened in the NListtree demo when the button "GetNr" was pressed
    while no list entry was selected.

2009-06-15 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func3.c: replaced the hand crafted clipboard accesses by
    proper iffparse.library calls. This circumvents the endian conversions and
    is much easier to understand.

2009-06-15 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * Made clipboard functions endiannes aware.

2009-06-08 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * AROS metamakefiles added.
  * Added "ioreq.io_Message.mn_Length = sizeof(ioreq)" because
    console.device won't open without this on AROS.
  * Some fixes for 64-bit AROS
  * Re-added some fixes from previous AROS port.

2009-06-06 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: adapted the whole build system to compile all NList classes
    finally for AROS. Now everything should compile and link fine with an
    AROS cross-compiler and if everything works out fine the next NList
    release will come with AROS binaries.

2009-05-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/SDI_lib.h: updated to the latest version.

2009-05-03 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: use 16-byte AltiVec alignment to maximise software
    blitting performance on Pegasos and Mac Mini.

2009-05-02 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * include/mccinit.c: RTF_EXTENDED was not set for the MorphOS build making
    revision number ineffective.

2009-04-30  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * updated the SDI headers to their latest fixed versions.

2009-04-21  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/Makefile: changed printf command to standard echo.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc1.c: adjusted some variable type due to the recent
    changes in the OS4 SDK.

2009-04-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: changed all makefiles to also include the AROS targets. In addition
    the whole build environment has been attached to compile all of our mcc
    and mcp classes for AROS. Now all NList classes should at least compile
    and link fine for AROS. If they properly work has to be tested first. :)

2009-04-08  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * updated the SDI headers and mccinit.c to their latest fixed versions.

2009-03-21  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: added missing MUI_DisposeObject() call for an
    Imagedisplay.mui object.

2009-01-30  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbalance_mcc/Makefile, nbitmap_mcc/Makefile: the OS4 build is now linked
    against newlib instead of clib2.
  * nlist_mcc/misc: added new tag MUIA_NList_IgnoreSpecialChars. This attribute
    accepts a NUL terminated string of characters to be ignored during string
    parsing. This is meant to be able to use special characters like 0xA0, which
    is used by some fonts (i.e. the Alpha character in some greek fonts). By
    default the 0xA0 character is used as a "non breaking space" and will be
    treated a such.
  * Makefile: removed the printf usage with the ANSI codes and replaced them
    by the more intuitive CC/LD echo output.
  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: completely rewrote the images shading. The class no
    longer grabs the already blitted images from the RastPort and applies a hand
    crafted alpha shade. Instead precalculated shade arrays are used and alpha
    blitted over the normal images. This speeds things up a lot.
  * nbitmap.c/misc: removed dependency on cybergraphics.library since everything
    is done via graphics.library now.
  * nbitmap.c/NBitmap.c, nbitmap_mcc/dispatcher.c: the latest changes didn't
    respect a possibly changed border size during AskMinMax.

2008-12-17  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/Makefile: modified Makefile to include the custom memory pool
    functions for OS2.x in the OS3 build only.
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: replaced some deprecated function calls by new
    ones for the the OS4 build.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_func3.c, nlist_mcc/cbio.c: replaced some deprecated function
    calls by new ones for the the OS4 build.

2008-07-01  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Pointer.c: reverted all AllocMem() calls back to AllocVec(). If chip RAM
    really is that precious, then a low chip memory situation will occur even
    before MUI is able to open a window with all bells and whistles enabled.
    Using AllocVec() instead of AllocMem() is really much more intuitive. Also
    made the color management for the pointer images OS2.x compatible by using
    GetRGB4() instead of GetRGB32(), which is OS3.x only. Although I really
    doubt anybody is still seriously using MUI 3.8+ on an OS2.x system in 2008.

2008-06-30  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * #?/Pointer.c: use MorphOS 2.0 system pointers. Also changed AllocVec()
    calls by AllocMem() to save precious chip ram.

2008-06-25  Vit Sindlar <sindlarv at centrum dot cz>

  * nlistviews_mcp/locale/czech.ct: Updated to match the latest .cd file.

#### v0.102 RELEASE ###########################################################

2008-06-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.102 release preparations
  * nbalance_mcc/NBalance.c: forgot to return MUIA_Version and
    MUIA_Revision for checking the version application-wise.
  * nlistviews_mcp: replaced the calloc() and free() usage against AllocVec()
    and FreeVec() because the alloc function can't be used in shared libraries.
  * Makefile: added a top-level makefile for easily compiling all things in
    a row. Also added an "install" target

2008-06-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbalance_mcc: added a new MUIA_NBalance_Pointer attribute to enable/disable
    the custom pointer for a NBalance object.
  * nbitmap_mcc/dispatcher.c: upon OM_SET our own tags will be set to TAG_IGNORE
    which should be more correct for tags parsing.

2008-06-21  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbalance_mcc/NBalance.c: changed the eventhandler's priority to -2 to make
    it called after Balance.mui's eventhandler. According to Jens this one has
    a priority of -1 and starts the balancing process after having received an
    IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE message. With pri 0 it could happen in some very rare cases
    that NBalance's eventhandler was called when the mouse pointer just left the
    object by one pixel and restore the standard pointer, but Balance.mui's
    eventhandler would start the balancing process from the very same message.
    Hence the balance process would happen with the standard mouse pointer
    instead of our custom one.

2008-06-20  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/mui/NBitmap_mcc.h: fixed some strange characters which prevented
    a successful build.

2008-06-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc: unified the global definitions for the attributes and
    variables to be taken from the global NBitmap_mcc.h file instead.
  * nlist_mcc/Pointer.c: changed the sizepointer image to be the very same as
    in the new NBalance class. This should make the whole custom pointer
    look&feel more consistent.
  * nbalance_mcc/NBalance.c: it seems I finally fixed the custom mouse pointer
    handling by using a correct logic of IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS|IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE
    events. Lets see how this performes in practice.

2008-06-19  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbalance_mcc/NBalance.c: removed the unneeded mouse button check as MUI
    doesn't broadcast any MUIM_HandleEvent messages any more as soon as some
    dragging or balancing has begun.
  * nbalance_mcc/NBalance.c: fixed the "reappearing normal pointer" problem, at
    least most of the time it works. Sometimes the last move event right before
    the balancing process starts yields that the mouse is no longer over the
    object, while in fact it still is.

2008-06-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbalance_mcc/NBalance.c: modified the mouse pointer show/hide functionality
    so that the custom mouse pointer is also shown when the balance object is
    being resized. This is, however, still not perfect because as soon as the
    resize operation is finished the custom pointer stays, which we need to
    solve before we can release a first version of the new NBalance class.

2008-06-13  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbalance_mcc/Pointer.c: fixed the wrong transparency of the horizontal
    pointer image.
  * nbalance_mcc: corrected the debug classes and simplified the setting
    of the different pointer images a little bit.

2008-06-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbalance_mcc: added sources of new custom class which enhances the standard
    mui MUIC_Balance custom class by adding a mouseover identification to show a
    different mouse pointer to signal that the mouse is over a balance object.
    In future we can even add new styles (look&feel) to this class to make it
    look more unique and how a balance object should look today.

2008-03-17  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/vastubs.c, #?/Makefile: added vararg stubs for OS3 to be able to link
    against clib2 which misses these stubs. Also added Lib#?Pooled()
    replacements which are missing in clib2 aswell.

2008-03-09  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlistviews_mcp/locale/swedish.ct: Updated according to changes.

2008-03-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: converted all TABs to spaces and cleanup the
    sources a bit.

2008-03-08  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/private.h: added missing variable

2008-03-07  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/Makefile, nlistviews/vastubs.c: added vararg stubs for
    certain functions to be able to links against clib2.
  * nlistviews_mcp/NListviews.c: the example text is localizable now. This
    fulfills feature request #1851580.

2008-03-04  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Makefile: removed -lm from the linker libs as nothing needs floating
    point math. Also added dump as target.
  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: replaced the shading factors by integers to avoid
    floating point math.

2008-02-19  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * nbitmap_mcc/WritePixelArrayAlpha.c: implemented WritePixelArrayAlpha() for
    M68k builds. Not very efficient but does its job.

2008-02-19  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Debug.h: replaced all abort() usages in our ASSERT() macros with the
    respective calls to assert(). This should prevent the MorphOS compile
    from not linking and be a bit more intuitiv.

2008-02-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mccinit.c: updated to latest version available which fixes some
    MorphOS specific compiler warnings.

2008-01-28  Daniel Allsopp <daniel@the-snakepit.co.uk>

  * nbitmap_mcc: Fixed various layout and redraw errors introduced with 15.4
    and implemented button labels.

2008-01-03  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?_mcp/locale/#?.ct: changed all .ct file names to english names instead of
    translated ones.

2008-01-02  Vit Sindlar <sindlarv at centrum dot cz>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/czech.ct: Updated to match the latest .cd file.

2007-12-27  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func4.c: no need to examine WhichLayer() on MorphOS 2.0
    because there custom pointers respect window borders.

#### v0.101 RELEASE ###########################################################

2007-12-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: last final release preparations.

2007-12-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp, nlisttree_mcp: added czech catalog generation to build
    makefiles.

2007-12-14  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c, nlist_mcc/NList_func4.c: the custom pointers will
    now only be shown if the mouse pointer is over the object AND over the
    object's window. If the window is partly covered by another window the
    normal pointer will be shown.

2007-12-12 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc0.c, nlist_mcc/Pointer.c: the
    custom pointers will now be set and hidden in the Show/Hide methods. Hiding
    them in the Cleanup method is forbidden, because the necessary window is not
    existing anymore then.

2007-12-12 Vit Sindlar <sindlarv at centrum dot cz>

  * nlistviews_mcp, nlisttree_mcp: added czech catalog translation

2007-12-07 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/icon.png: added example picture with alpha channel.
  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: added some debug output to track down transparency
    problems with OS3.

2007-12-07  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/NListtree_mcp.cd: fixed typo.
  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/english-british.ct: added, OS4 only for now.
  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/svenska.ct: fixed version string, added the
    missing codeset, removed all the Localizer junk, fixed the artificial
    typo in MSG_HELP_SPECIAL_IMAGE.
  * ChangeLog: minor cleanup.

2007-12-06  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/svenska.ct: Updated according to changes.

2007-12-03  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c, nlisttree_mcp/locale/NListtree_mcp.cd:
    reworked catalog descriptor from the ground up, now only help bubbles
    for the "Expand" and "Collapse" buttons are missing (hint :).

2007-12-03  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: fixed some indentations.
  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap-Test.c: added missing includes and library definitions.

2007-12-01  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/svenska.ct: Updated according to the new .cd file.

2007-11-30  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap-Test.c: added simple test application for nbitmap.mcc.
    It requires icon.png file which is not included for copyright reasons.
  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: fixed rendering bugs caused by my CGX patch.
  * nbitmap_mcc/dispatcher.c: removed obsolete MUI_RequestIDCMP()/MUI_RejectIDCMP()
    calls. Event handlers are used instead.

2007-11-22  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: moved the inclusion of the proto/#?.h files a few
    lines further down to avoid unnecessary warnings when compiling for OS3.
    The OS3 proto files don't seem to include the necessary stuff to define
    Bitmaps, etc, themself.

2007-11-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc: integrated a patch kindly provided by Ilkka Lehtoranta
    which makes the bitmap class compile/link for MorphOS and OS3 as well.
    Now cybergraphics.library calls are used for all platforms instead of
    forcing the class to P96 only. Please note, however, that we still
    need a test application for that new class as currently the only
    application using that new class is Epistula and that's unfortunatly
    available for OS4 only :(. So we should at least put a NBitmap-Test
    app into our repository for testing it directly from here.

2007-11-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/NListviews.c: added a copyright crawling object to the
    bottom of the mcp to match the Look&Feel to our other classes.
  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: reworked the whole mcp GUI to not fire up a
    sub window for the copyright and/or example listtree. In addition, the
    locale translation stuff now uses FlexCat instead of the old, obsolete
    and properitary Localizer stuff. However, new translation are now
    required.

2007-11-03  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/svenska.ct: Just upped the version number.

2007-11-02  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: added all buttons to the cycle chain. This fixes
    bug #1824550.
  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: added the missing control chars for the style and
    space sliders.

2007-11-02  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: the URL in the Copyright window no longer
    points to an empty homepage (fixes bug #1824552), also updated the
    copyright dates and general indentation to make it more readable
  * docs/ReadMe: general rework and preparations for next release

2007-10-14  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc0.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: moved the MUI key handling
    to the HandleEvent() function, because this function can signal an "eaten"
    key press to MUI. The now empty HandleInput() function has been removed
    therefore. This fixes the strange folder listtree behaviour in YAM.
  * nlisttree_mcc/Debug.c, nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: refined the debugging
    flags a lot to get more detailed information.

#### v0.100 RELEASE ###########################################################

2007-10-12  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/Pointer.c: for OS4 the normal bitmap data are now used for the
    fallback pointers in case the graphic card cannot handle 32bit hardware
    sprites as pointer.

2007-10-11  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nist_mcc/Pointer.c: the combinated bitplane is now also declared as constant
    data instead of "calculating" it.

2007-10-10  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: removed the DefaultObjectOnClick workaround for
    MUI3.8/m68k which is no longer necessary, as the corrent return of
    MUI_EventHandlerRC_Eat for handled mouse clicks inside the object also
    cured the "first click does not select" bug in YAM.

2007-10-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: the MUIKEY_LEFT/RIGHT always ate the keyevent
    instead of just eating it in case NListtree itself reacted upon the key
    press. This prevented NListtree from being able to be horizontally scrollable
    in addition to reacting upon the new KeyLeft/RightFocus attributes.
  * nlist_mcc: implemented new MUIA_NList_KeyXXXFocus attributes which can be
    set to another object in the same window the NList object resists. In case
    the corresponding key action (Up/Down/Left/Right) is processed with no actual
    scrolling/changing action being performed, the selected object will become
    the new active object of the window.

2007-10-09  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c: the inactive color is now also used if the list's
    window is inactive. That means the list AND the window must be active to
    let the list be drawn with its active colors.

2007-10-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: the new MUIV_NList_Redraw_Selected wasn't updating
    list objects which are in MUIV_NList_TypeSelect_Char mode.

2007-10-08  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc0.c, nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: added new redraw type
    MUIV_NList_Redraw_Selected to redraw selected entries only. This new type
    is needed by the recently added (in)active highlighting.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: the latest changes revealed another bug in NList
    when running under OS3. The HandleEvent method did not signal MUI that a
    mouse click was eaten and upon changing the active object MUI issued the
    same message again to the same object which in turn thought that the user
    did a double click on the listview. Fixed this bug by returning the correct
    value in this case. Caution: a similar effect may happen under different
    circumstances again! We really need to check when MUI_EventHandlerRC_Eat
    must be returned an when it must not!

2007-10-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: implemented a new MUIA_NList_ActiveObjectOnClick method which
    will not only make sure that upon clicking into an NList object, this
    object will become the currently active object of the window.
  * nlist_mcc, nlistview_mcc: the NListview class will now catch the GoActive
    and GoInactive methods of MUI and forward them to NList so that NList can
    react on the activation/deactivation of the objects and show different
    background colors for active and inactive listviews.

2007-09-23  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlistviews_mcp/locale: Added swedish translation for the new NListviews.mcp.
  * nlistviews_mcp/Makefile: Added swedish to the available translations.

2007-09-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: changed all background and foreground pen relevant sections to
    take note of the new upcoming inactive pen color configurable in NListviews.mcp
    now.

2007-09-17  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/Pointer.c: too much data was copied while setting up the bitmaps
    for the pointers, which caused crashes with the OS3 build as soon as either
    the move or size pointer should be displayed. Also fixed a coloring issue
    with the size and move pointers.

2007-09-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: removed all stackchecking functionality regardless if we can compile
    them conditionally via DO_STACK_CHECK or not. It was about time to do a cleanup
    of NList and this should be a first step. Stack checking shouldn't really be
    required on any platform. And if so anything can be restored in one go by
    reverting this change via subversion (SVN).
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c: now that our new preferences also allows to enable
    disable the new char selection pointer we now check for the settings in NList
    as well.
  * nlistviews_mcp: reworked the whole preferences GUI and finally got rid of
    all the nonsense Misc1-MiscX register tabs. All the various options are now
    grouped together based on their purpose. In addition, the preferences GUI
    is now fully localized which should allow to generate translations for every
    language. All in all the whole preference program should have a more
    professional, clear and intuitive look&feel now like it should have been
    right from the start.

2007-09-14  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: hopefully fixed the "first click does not select"
    bug. This occured with MUI3.8/m68k only when two lists within one windows
    both have set MUIA_NList_DefaultObjectOnClick to TRUE. In this case the
    second, inactive list never gets activated on the first click. OS4 and
    MorphOS don't seem to be unaffected by this.

2007-09-13  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * docs/MCC_NList.doc: added a note to MUIA_NList_StackCheck that this tag is
    a no-op from the next release on.
  * misc: removed the complete stack checking mechanism for various reasons.
    Fist, stack checking causes serious performance penalties. Compared to
    MUI's own List class NList class is quite slow and stack checking just
    makes things worse. Second, if the stack size for an application is too
    low it will very likely crash in other parts and not just while processing
    NList stuff. Third, when you got a warning requester before telling you to
    increase the stack size you did so just to get rid of that requester. This
    requester was shown if the free stack size dropped below a certain limit.
    By increasing the stack size the requester vanished, but there is no
    guarantee that the increased stack is really needed. The check is just a
    rough estimation without any calculated requirement which will be exceeded.
    Nevertheless, stack checking can be enabled again by compiling NList.mcc
    with DO_STACK_CHECK #define'd.

2007-09-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp: added a new 'Inactive' Pen and FrameSpec pop object for the
    upcoming inactive cursor color being introduced to e.g. NList itself. In
    addition, as the pointer color selections in now fully automatic the config
    item to manually select the black color has been removed - minor cleanups
    included.

2007-09-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/Pointer.c: fixed an issue where in case some other gadget/process
    set the window pointer to something else we might have ended up with the
    wrong or no custom pointer at all.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: in case a NList object is in the charwise selection
    mode a specialized selection pointer will now be shown instead of just
    showing the normal pointer image. This should make the charwise selection
    more obvious and intuitive and be in line what TextEditor.mcc now does as
    well.

2007-09-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/Pointer.c, misc: reworked the whole mouse pointer setup/cleanup
    routines from scratch and adapted them to use 32bit ARGB pointer images in
    case NList is compiled for AmigaOS4. In addition to black/white color setup
    works now all automatically like previously introduced in TextEditor.mcc.
    This whole thing should finally allow to remove the configuration for the
    pointer color in the NList configuration as well as showing a specialized
    select pointer in case the mouse is above a read-only floattext object.

2007-09-02  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/svenska.ct: Just bumped the version number to match
    v18.13 release of nlisttree.mcp.

2007-08-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c: partly fixed bug #1172351 where due to consequtive
    DrawText() calls at the very same position the font display is messed
    up if the font is anti-aliased. The problem seems to be that not the entire
    background where the new text is drawn will be cleared right before executing
    the DrawText() function. However, due to the overlapping of italic text NList
    requires to also at least redraw one character before and after the char that
    should be initially redrawn. Unfortunately this isn't quite easy to achieve in
    the DrawLines() function as there doesn't seem to be a way to check the exact
    width of the pre/post-fixed char. Therefore only some additional space is
    cleared/redrawn as well (data->spacesize) which in fact isn't quite correct
    and ends up in still having a screwed up font display in case the user
    quickly selects/deselects over the vers same area if TypeSelect is set to
    charwise selection. More work is required here, but due to the ugly source
    code it would be hard to find/fix the issues quickly.

2007-08-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: added new MUIA_NList_AutoClip attribute which allows to disable
    the default behaviour of an NList object where in read-only (NoInput) mode
    when MUIA_NList_TypeSelect is set to select charwise, the content will be
    automatically copied to the clipboard. This should allow to set a NList object
    to comply with the Amiga styleguide where always Amiga+C should be used to
    manually copy the selected content to the clipboard.
  * nlist_mcc/NList-Test.c: added the sources of the NList demo as a new test
    application which will be directly linked against the NList objects and therefore
    allows to more easily/quickly test changes in the NList code.
  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.10 version

2007-08-16  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: translated a german comment to english and
    commented out two further lines which broke the build.
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: upon MUIM_NListtree_Redraw only visible nodes are
    redrawn to avoid unnecessary overhead.

#### v0.99 RELEASE ############################################################

2007-07-25  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/library.c: now really uses the 3 parameter version of GETINTERFACE()
    defined in mccinit.c instead of the old obsolete version in mcc_common.h.
    The user definable functions (i.e. ClassInit()) must be declared before
    the inclusion of mccinit.c.
  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.8 version which really uses the
    GETINTERFACE() macro with 3 parameters.

2007-07-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.7 version

2007-07-24  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.6 version which fixes an unbalanced
    if statement.

2007-07-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.5 version which should take care
    of stack issues.

2007-07-12  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: added platform dependend type definition of
    LocaleBase.

2007-07-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.4 version and adapted all our
    library.c files to make use out of the new stack enforcing mechanisms.

2007-07-03  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c, nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: added some more
    typecasts to the image generating functions to please GCC.
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: added some typecasts to the debug output to
    please GCC.

2007-07-02  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: added some NULL pointer checks to the debug
    output.

2007-06-26  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: somehow the latest fixes for the bugs #1190788 and
    #1720456 didn't make it into the repository. Commited them again.
  * misc: removed all trailing "\n" of all debug macros, as these clutter the
    debug output.

2007-06-22  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * docs/MCC_NList.doc: added the necessary requirements for AutoCopyToClip to
    be working. The object must either be the window's active or default object.

2007-06-21  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: the Class element of an IntuiMessage was assigned
    a non-zero value instead of checking it, which made NList.mcc to start
    dragging single items in certain situations. Now a correct check is done.
    This fixes bug #1627687.

2007-06-20  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: fixed bugs #1190788 and #1720456 by uncommenting a
    previously commented out line. If a line is now marked up to the right
    border and then copied to the clipboard the beginning of the following line
    will no longer be copied as well. Please check and report if this fix has
    any other negative side effect.

2007-06-15  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/NListviews.c: the raw key conversion was completely broken
    due to the latest changes. Now a separate buffer is used which is appended
    to the hotkey string.
  * demo/Makefile.#?: fixed wrong include path.
  * nbitmap/dispatcher.c, nbitmap/NBitmap.c: replaced SetMem() calls by standard
    memset() calls, as SetMem() is OS4-only.
  * nbitmap/private.h: added missing declarations of the OS4 specific types
    int8/16/32 and uint8/16/32 to make NBitmap.mcc compilable for OS3 and MOS.
  * nbitmap/dispatcher.c: moved all variable definitions in front of the ENTER()
    macro.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: added some range and NULL pointer checks to the
    MUIM_NList_GetSelectInfo method.

2007-06-14  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: replaced all remaining occurences of strcpy() by strlcpy(). stpcpy()
    has been replaced by strlcat().
  * misc: replaced all remaining occurences of sprintf() by snprintf().

2007-06-13  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Debug.c: unified the _DPRINTF() functions for all platforms.
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: replaced all calls to sprintf() and strncat()
    by sizeaware calls to snprintf() and strlcat(). This effectively makes
    buffer overruns impossible. Additionally the buffer pointer no longer needs
    to be passed around to all functions.

2007-06-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * #?/Makefile: replaced all platform specific makefiles with a single
    platform flexible one which can be called by a simple 'make' call and
    automatically identify for which platform it should compile the mcc/mcp.
  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.1 version which should fix possible
    stack issues during the LibInit() phase. Custom libraries will now be opened
    during the LibOpen() phase instead while maintaining an own mutual exclusive
    locking variable.

2007-06-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccinit.c, mcc/library.c, mcp/library.c: replaced the old obsolete
    mccheader.c by the new mccinit.c which should come with a much more clear
    interface and documentation on how to use it for a basis of a MUI custom
    class. This should significantly reduce the possibility of race conditions
    in the mcc/library init code.

2007-05-29  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Debug.c: added some const keywords.
  * include/mccheader.c: reworked the LibOpen() and LibClose() functions to
    increment/decrement the lib_Open counter before obtaining the semaphore to
    prevent a possible race condition with LibExpunge().

2007-05-02  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func2.c: a wrong flag was used to signal a pending
    notification for MUIA_NList_DragSortInsert. Using the correct flag should
    fix bug #1668322.

2007-05-01  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: the GetEntry method didn't respect closed lists
    when counting then nodes and hence the first node of a closed list was
    always returned while the next node was skipped.

2007-04-24  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: fixed an aliasing break by replacing a DoMethodA()
    call by a varargs DoMethod() call.

2007-03-23  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Debug.c: fixed wrong final output of debug classes and flags.
  * #?/Debug.c: disabling a debug flag was not possible due to a check for the
    '!' at a wrong index.

2007-03-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp: added russian catalog translation kindly provided by
    Vlad Vinogradov.

2007-01-20  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/misc: reworked some more sources to look a *lot* nicer.

2007-01-10  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/misc: reworked some sources to look a *lot* nicer. Also added
    two new debugging classes "datatype" and "draw" to capture possible flaws in
    these areas.

2007-01-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc: added the sources of our new NBitmap.mcc custom class
    kindly developed and provided by Daniel Allsopp in 2006. Currently the class
    only compiles on AmigaOS4, but future versions should be ported to OS3 and MOS
    as well and should also be running on cybergraphics.library systems. This new
    class provides general purpose methods for loading/drawing all kind of bitmaps
    (either loaded from a file or dtObject) including methods for applying certain
    image modifications in advance. This class should also allow to load images
    which can contain alpha-channel masking like e.g. 32bit PNG files. All in all
    it should be the next generation MUI custom class for dealing with all kind
    of images and their operations/display.

#### v0.98 RELEASE ############################################################

2006-12-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * demo: added makefiles and made all our demos compile for all our different
    targets like OS3/OS4/MOS.

2006-12-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc: applied a fix for certain tree open/close related problems
    kindly provided by Thomas Igracki. NListtree was previously adding certain
    items twice when opening a list tree. In addition if only a few items were
    part of a list tree certain items weren't correctly or at all displayed.

2006-12-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: bumped versions for upcoming release and adapted
    makefiles to compile with -Wwrite-strings.

2006-12-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: changed all get() uses to xget() uses and also made sure
    that all attribute checking get() are directly using GetAttr().
  * nlist_mcc: minor changes to the makefiles so that the class is always
    compiled with function symbols turned on, no matter what.

2006-11-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/local/svenska.ct: added swedish catalog translation kindly
    provided by PÃr Boberg.
  * nlisttree_mcp: moved the "locale" directory to here because each mcp
    should have its own directory instead of accessing a global one

2006-10-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc: transformed all "struct TimeVal" definitions into separate
    ULONG values as a real timeval structure is not really required. Also
    adapted the HandleEvent method to use the current time supplied by the
    intuimessage instead which should be more accurate.
  * includes/SDI_hook.h: updated to latest version and adapted our sources
    accordingly.

2006-10-07  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Debug.c/h: Ooops. Forgot to check in the debug sources... :(

2006-10-06  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: converted some left over old D(bug())'s.
  * misc: added new debugging scheme, as known from YAM and TextEditor.mcc.
    Therefore the now obsolete file includes/mcc_debug.h is gone. The
    debugging facility is far from perfect and yet just covers the absolute
    minimum of debugging. That means one cannot yet define precise debugging
    classes.

2006-10-04  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * includes/mccheader.c, #?/Makefile.os4: switched to newlib compilation and
    linkage per default.

2006-10-03  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: removed several signedness issues
  * nlisttree_mcc/Makefile.os4: added -D__NEW_TIMEVAL_DEFINITION_USED__ to
    CFLAGS
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c,h, nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: changed all
    usages of "struct timeval" to new "struct TimeVal" and all usages of
    "tv_secs" and "tv_micro" to "Seconds" and "Microseconds".
  * include/SDI_#?: updated SDI headers to very latest available versions
    which should fix compilation issues with VBCC and the VARARGS68K
    definition.
  * include/#?mui#?: updated MUI heards to very latest available versions
    which don't include any <clib/#?> directly anymore.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c: the code to return the current pixel length of a
    line didn't check for -1 as an invalid index and therefore caused crashes
    if the list was contained in a virtual group and was scrolled into view
    very slowly. -1 is the index of the title bar. This fixes bug #1568047.

#### v0.97 RELEASE ############################################################

2005-07-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c,NList_mcc2.c: modified wheelmouse aware source
    code to take respect of the new AmigaOS4 specific IDCMP_EXTENDEDMOUSE
    events supported since intuition.library v51.28+.

2005-07-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/QuickSort.c: added removed <proto/utility.h> include
    back as the OS4 SDK requires it for resolving CallHook() properly.

2005-06-24  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

  * nfloattext_mcc/NFloattext.c: Cleanup #include statements.
    (DoSuperNew): use SDI_stdarg.h.
    (CopyText, mNFT_GetEntry): Use MEMF_ANY when allocating memory.
    (mNFT_Set, mNFT_GetEntry): Remove superfluous casts.
    (mNFT_GetEntry): Use CopyMem().
    (CopyText): Use strcpy().
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c (OpenClipboard/CloseClipboard): Fixed.
    (DoSuperNew, MyCallHook): Use SDI_stdarg.h.
    (MyCallHookA: Disabled since its unused.
    Use stdlib.h
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c, nlisttree_mcc/QuickSort.c: Cleanup
    #include statements.
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.h: Removed excessive header inclusion.
  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: minor cleanup.
  * nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: Cleanup #include statements.
    (DoSuperNew): Use SDI_stdarg.h.
  * nlistview_mcc/Makefile.os3, nlistview_mcc/Makefile.os4,
    nlistview_mcc/Makefile.mos (CFLAGS): Added -I.. to get rid of ".."
    in #include statement.
  * nlistviews_mcp/NListviews.c: Cleanup #include statements.

2005-06-23  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: Removed LocaleBase and its interface
    definition.
    (_DisposeP): moved CloseCat() and CloseLocale() inside the
    "if (LocaleBase)" block.
  * nlisttree_mcc/library.c: Added LocaleBase defintions.
  * nfloattext_mcc/private.h, nlist_mcc/private.h, nlisttree_mcc/private.h,
    nlisttree_mcp/private.h, nlistview_mcc/private.h, nlistviews_mcp/private.h:
    Remove some unnessecary "../includes/". Use "" for private includes.
  * nlist_mcc/Makefile.os3, nlist_mcc/Makefile.os4, nlist_mcc/Makefile.mos:
    Added -I.. to get rid of ".." in #include statements.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_grp.h, nlist_mcc/NList_img.h, nlist_mcc/NList_img2.h:
    Minor cleanups.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc0.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc1.c,
    nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc3.c, nlist_mcc/NList4_mcc.c,
    nlist_mcc/NList_mcc5.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c, nlist_mcc/NList_func.c,
    nlist_mcc/NList_func2.c, nlist_mcc/NList_func3.c, nlist_mcc/NList_func4.c,
    nlist_mcc/NList_grp.c, nlist_mcc/NList_img.c, nlist_mcc/NList_img2.c,
    nlist_mcc/move.c, nlist_mcc/library.c: Add #include statements for used
    headers.
  * nlist_mcc/private.h: Removed excessive header inclusion.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc3.c (xget): Initialize local variable. Remove unused
    MUIA_ #define.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc5.c: Removed xget() prototype.
  * nlist_mcc/protos.h: Added xget() prototype.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_func3.c (MyCallHookPktA): use SDI_stdarg.h.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c (DoSuperNew): Likewise.
  * nlist_mcc/library.c: Make ioreq static.

2005-06-16  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c, nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: Unify MySPrintf
    for OS4 and MOS using SDI_starg.h as done by other projects.
    Fix OS3 MySPrintf for GCC 3.4.x or newer (has to use stdarg.h macros!)
    Initialize variable passed to GetAttr() with Zero.
    Includes cleanup.
    Fixed typos.

2005-06-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * includes/SDI: updated SDI headers to latest incarnation.

2005-05-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * library.c: added missing USE_UTILITYBASE define which may have caused
    problems on OS3 machines.

2005-04-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * includes/mccclass_68k: replaced the assembler based OS4/68k stub by a
    easier manageable C-based variant.

2005-04-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * all: fixed case sensitive #include statements which broke the
    build on systems with a case sensistive filesystem.
  * includes/SDI*: updated the common SDI headers with latest
    version taken from the YAM repository.

2005-03-21  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

  * all: Minor source cleanup.

2005-03-17  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NListtree_mcc: Addressed bug 1095158 by rewritting the
    responsible parts. This might introduce other problems and
    needs proper testings.

2005-03-16  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NList_mcc: Fixed base page access which happened when no entry
    was selected and the keyboard was used (bug 1156362)

2005-01-01  Nicolas Sallin <henes@biclodon.com>

  * NList_mcc: Fixed wrong usage of MUI_MAXMAX

#### v0.96 RELEASE ############################################################

2004-12-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * made sure all revisions/dates are bumped of all NList classes
    for upcoming new NList release.

2004-12-15  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NList_mcc: On some circumstances MUIA_NList_InsertPositions was not
    set correctly if the element has been inserted via
    MUIV_NList_Insert_Sorted. Hopfully fixed now.

2004-12-14  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NList_mcc: Fixed insert refresh problem

2004-12-13  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NList_mcc:  Fixed offset refresh bug
  * NList_mcc, NListviews_mcp: Added new prefs option to disable
    the vertical centering of the text lines (can be found on the
    misc2 sub page)
  * NListviews_mcp: Eliminated a misc sub page. In the future the
    rest should be eliminated as well.

2004-10-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccclass_68k.S: updated mcc 68k->PPC cross call stubs to
    latest version created by fdtrans 51.1

2004-10-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>,
            Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * mccheader.c: Special Fun of Computing fix. Return value of
    PreClassInitFunc() was not evaluated.

2004-09-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * all: modified all makefiles to use "-W -Wall" as the warning
    level and adapted all source files accordingly. Reactivated
    the DEBUG options in all morphos makefiles aswell as the
    debugging options can be dynamically disabled on the
    commandline by "make DEBUG=" anyway.

2004-08-26  Nicolas Sallin <henes@morphos.de>

  * All: More changes for morphos.

2004-08-25  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NList4_func4.c: Fixed wrong disposion of mouse pointer
    objects. Bug found by Georg Steger.

2004-08-25  Nicolas Sallin <henes@morphos.de>

  * All: Changes for morphos.

2004-08-24  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NListtree: Fixed alignment problems (the alignment enforcement
    surrounding include statements was discarded by subincludes).
    The events are now only subscribed between MUIM_Show/MUIM_Hide
    rather than MUIM_Setup/MUIM_Cleanup as otherwise MUI sends
    them even if the object is not showed (e.g. within a page).
    Frozen version 18.20 of NListtree.

2004-08-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: fixed a rather annoying drawing bug where the
    NList class wasn't calculating the correct vertical start
    position on drawing the listview. This causes a very annoying
    "stutterting" when instantly resizing the NList surrounding
    group. However, this seems to trigger now another hided minor
    drawing bug where not all of the vertical space of the NList
    object is used. So this is something we have to look after
    aswell.

2004-07-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mccheader.c: updated the general mcc source file to the
    latest version also used with other .mcc's out there. Also
    adapted all library.c files to define the USEDCLASSES stuff
    correctly.

2004-07-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * gcc3: adapted all sources to be more gcc3 compliant. Removed
    all remaining warnings in -Wall mode. Please note that at
    least for the AmigaOS4 port of the classes gcc 3.4.1 should
    be considered the default compiler now.

2004-07-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp: added the missing mcp class of the nlisttree
    class and ported it to native OS4 aswell.

2004-07-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * all: built some first OS4/PPC native versions of all classes
    and added makefiles for it accordingly.
  * all: fixed all remaining compiler warnings which occurred
    with -Wall.
  * all: updated and reorganized all NList classes to use the
    SDI_*.h header files to make it way easier to maintain the
    source code for different operating systems like OS4 and MOS.

2003-02-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * NList.mcc: fixed bug in the Draw method were it could have
    happened that on a LAYERSREFRESH request the object wasn`t
    correctly refreshed.

2003-02-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * added USEDCLASSES and USEDCLASSESP to all NList related
    classes so that the preferences/superclass ordering is
    a bit more accurate.

2003-02-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * NList.mcc: added new MUIV_NList_Insert_Flag_Raw flag to
    the MUIM_NList_Insert method. With this special flag the
    developer is able to insert a bunch of data into a NList
    without recalculating/reordering the columns width. As tests
    pointed out the most significant speed loss while inserting
    entries to a NList is the recalculating of the width of
    each column. So, if  a developer is sure that he doesn`t need
    to recalculate the columns width each time he inserts something,
    he can now specify this flag and those entries will be inserted
    with higher performance.
    Tests have shown that ~8000 elements can be inserted now within
    1-2 seconds instead of 8-9 seconds.
  * NListtree.mcc: replaced Insert/RemoveTreeNodeVisibleSort()
    functions by one ReplaceTreeNodeVisibleSort() function
    that calls MUIM_NList_ReplaceSingle instead. That speeds up
    the sorting of a treenode to a factor of ~170%.
  * NListtree.mcc: removed broken flashsort implementation
    as it anyway didn`t work correctly and wasn`t also
    the best one for that sorting purpose. Replaced it with
    a own Quicksort implementation and also use the same
    algorithm now for the 68k version. As some test showed
    the C implementation is as fast as the former ASM one and
    in addition we have more flexibility now.

2003-02-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * NListview.mcc: implemented similar MUIA_ControlChar support
    like the original Listview.mui supports it since ages.
    By specifying a MUIA_ControlChar for a NListview object it
    is now possible to specify a hotkey to control the active
    entry of the corresponding NList.

2003-01-07  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * NListtree: No default Compare Hook was set.

2002-12-31  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree/nlisttree.c: if a own ConstructHook was
    set via SetAttributes, the whole flags were deleted.
    Instead of a unset bit operation a masking operation
    was used which caused that whole flags screwup. Fixed.

2002-11-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree: updated sources to conform better with newest
    morphos SDK.

2002-11-02  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * NListtree: No longer copies the compare hook, instead
    it uses the pointer directly

2002-10-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/nlist_mcc.c: fixed bug in the internal
    ConstructHook_String where Sensei forgot to terminate
    the copied string with a \0.

2002-09-13  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * NListtree: MUIM_NListtree_Remove had problems when no entry
    was active. Fixed.

2002-07-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/nlist_mcc2.c: fixed a tiny, but extremly nasty
    bug that caused unnecessary refreshs of nlist objects
    if we had more than one nlist#? object within a group.

2002-07-01  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * The internal pool problem wasn't really fixed. Now it is (I hope)

2002-06-23  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * Fixed a bug that the images weren't displayed in single
    columned lists

2002-06-22  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * Create also an Internal Pool if user pool was specified
    as some functions require this

2002-06-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

  * obviously turned this ChangeLog upside down because it
    makes more sense :)
  * removed common/mcc_debug.c as we use dprintf() for MorphOS
    now for debugging purposes.
  * removed the need of creating own ppc headerfiles with
    geninclude.pl, because we can use #pragma pack(2) instead.
  * Updated the MorphOS stuff in all classes to use varargs68k
    stuff instead of this outdated varargs hacks.
  * Did lots of effort to get the whole NList* stuff
    up and running under MorphOS again. Somehow the builds
    where broken.
  * tagged all classes within the CVS with their respect
    release version, so that they can be identified later.

  * Special ShortHelp Notes...
    * When an Button Image Object is given a ShortHelp and the Mouse is positioned over the button,
      the ShortHelp for that object will be shown, otherwise the Default ShortHelp for the full
      NList object itself will be shown
  * Not really much of a change - but made CPU=68030 in NList_mcc/smakefile due to my own requirements
  * Bumped version of NList.mcc to 20.104
  * Obviously added info to ChangeLog :-)

2002-03-05  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * Added a define MUIV_NList_UseImage_All for MUIM_NList_UseImage
    which stands now for -1

2001-12-24  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * Merged aphaso and sensei changes and commited all files to the
    cvs (only tried the SAS compile)
  * small smakefile changes

2001-07-01  sensei <sensei@box43.gnet.pl>

  * Added new methods MUIM_NList_Construct and MUIM_NList_Destruct.  Now
    every internal method is calling these methods instead of playing
    with hooks directly.  In NList subclass you can override them to your
    own version.
  * Fixed IdStrings again...  MUI dislikes MCC which haven't $VER:  at
    the beggining of IdString and AboutMUI wasn't showing such MCC (but
    MCC is working correctly!) in the list...
  * Fixed global and local SMakefiles (dependency tree was broken (by me)
    and "sometimes" project wasn't rebuilded...) In global smakefile
    'all' was missing and it cauesed some troubles with objects/
    directories (this's not my fault).
  * Added useful scripts to make and clean objects/ directories.
  * Bumped version of NList.mcc to 20.103

2001-06-27  sensei <sensei@box43.gnet.pl>

  * Changed memory handling routines in NList_func3.c and NList_mcc.c
  * Changed common/mccheader.h to support SAS/C.
  * Changed NList_mcc/NList_mcc.c OM_NEW attributes handling, minor speedup.
  * Fixed every library.c of each MCC, first function of library based
    executable MUST do nothing and return 0.  Executing old MCC causes
    unexpected crashes.
  * Fixed and cleanuped OM_GET method of NList.mcc getting
    MUIA_NList_DragColOnly attribute could cause unexpected results!
  * Fixed library id string. It's not equal to version string!
  * Added missed names of authors in id string.
  * Bumped version of NList.mcc to 19.102

2001-06-23  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Added MorphOS DoSuperMethod() to NFloattext.c
  * Added common/mcc_debug.h for better debugging ;)
  * Changed common/mcc_debug.c
  * Changed common/mcc_common.h to support GNU/SAS...
  * Changed some internal handling and added tree class support
    in NList ;-)
  * Changed version strings to NList#?.mcc ...
  * Bumped version of NList.mcc to 19.101
  * Fixed wrong MorphOS hooks...

2001-06-20  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Enforcer hit on dispose removed.
  * Now omits column width calculation code if numcols == 1.
    With only one column, NList is now faster than List. Yeahh!
  * Shrink of entries array is now omitted. Same as List does i
    think.

2001-06-18  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Added experimental value MUIV_NList_Redraw_ColsVisible for
    width calc of only the visible lines.

2001-06-16  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Reworked entry manangement to use pointers insted of full
    structures. This makes NList much faster (factor 3-4) in
    some cases, but slows down a bit when inserting entries at
    the bottom. Not much...

2001-06-14  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Tracked back the floattext wrap bug and fixed it (*_mcc4.c).
    All important lines which were changed between 0.89 and 0.89+
    by Gilles and caused the wrap bug are marked with $$$WRAP for
    future reference.

2001-02-27  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Moved Floattext to own directory and added MorphOS changes

2001-02-18  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Re-added makefiles for m68k ;)
  * Added method MUIM_NList_SelectChange
  * Automatic conversion of NList_mcc.h in
    NList_mcc/makefile.ppc
  * Bumped version to 19.98

2000-12-17  Gürer <madcat@linuxfan.com>

  * initial cvs commit
  * mui classes moved to their own directories
  * ppc makefiles added
  * stack check disabled (wasn't compatible with morphos)
  * nlist, nlistview, nlistviews, nfloattext ported to morphos
    (varius hook, vararg, etc patches)
