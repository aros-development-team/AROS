Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
BetterString is a stringgadget replacement. It is created for MUI, so using it
should eliminate the problems with the original BOOPSI stringclass.
The class offers the user to do number arithmetic, like increase, decrease and
bin<->hex conversion. It has filename completion, ability to mark, cut, copy
and paste text - Both via mouse and keyboard. The length of the contents
buffer will dynamically be expanded to hold all of what the user type (unless
a maximum length is given)

It is used by a wide range of well-known MUI-based application like YAM
(Yet Another Mailer) or SimpleMail as the main textediting MUI gadget.
