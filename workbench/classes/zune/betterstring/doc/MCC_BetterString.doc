BetterString is a stringgadget replacement. It is created for MUI, so using it
should eliminate the problems with the original BOOPSI stringclass.
The class offers the user to do number arithmetic, like increase, decrease and
bin<->hex conversion. It has filename completion, ability to mark, cut, copy
and paste text - Both via mouse and keyboard. The length of the contents
buffer will dynamically be expanded to hold all of what the user type (unless
a maximum length is given)

BetterString is released as POLYMORPH-WARE, which means that you need to pay
or give me, whatever you want your users to pay or give you.

This autodoc only describes what is new, compared to the original "String.mui".
All tags and methods of the old String.mui is supported, except edit hooks.

   The class can be set to remember what has been previously typed, and allows
   the user to go back and forth in the history buffer.

BetterString.mcc/MUIA_BetterString_Columns

    NAME
        MUIA_BetterString_Columns -- [I..], ULONG

    FUNCTION
        Set the width of the stringgadget (in characters)
        This tag is probably only useful for webbrowsers.

BetterString.mcc/MUIA_BetterString_NoInput

    NAME
        MUIA_BetterString_NoInput -- [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        Effectively turns the gadget into read-only mode.

BetterString.mcc/MUIA_BetterString_SelectSize

    NAME
        MUIA_BetterString_SelectSize -- [.SG], LONG

    FUNCTION
        Get or set the number of selected characters.
        A negative value indicates that the marking has happend right to left.
        A 0 means nothing is marked.

BetterString.mcc/MUIA_BetterString_StayActive

    NAME
        MUIA_BetterString_StayActive -- [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        Setting this attribute to TRUE will let the stringgadget stay active,
        even when the user hits return, or clicks outside the gadgets area.

BetterString.mcc/MUIM_BetterString_ClearSelected

    NAME
        MUIM_BetterString_ClearSelected

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj, MUIM_BetterString_ClearSelected);

    FUNCTION
        Clear all marked text, if any!

    RESULT
        NONE

BetterString.mcc/MUIM_BetterString_FileNameStart

    NAME
        MUIM_BetterString_FileNameStart

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj, MUIM_BetterString_FileNameStart, STRPTR buffer, LONG pos);

    FUNCTION
        When the user press Amiga+TAB, then BetterString will call this
        method, with a pointer to the current buffer, and a cursor position.
        It expects the method to return the start position of the partial
        file, which the cursor is currently at.

        Generally BetterString's own implementation is clever enough to find
        it, but if for example you use the stringgadget in a webbrowser, where
        the file is prefixed with "file://", then it isn't.

    RESULT
        The start of the file or MUIR_BetterString_FileNameStart_Volume if no
        file is found, this will make BetterString treat the string as the
        beginning of a volumne, and make it do volume-completion instead.

BetterString.mcc/MUIM_BetterString_Insert

    NAME
        MUIM_BetterString_Insert

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj, MUIM_BetterString_Insert, STRPTR text, LONG pos);

    FUNCTION
        This will insert the given text.
        The position of the inserted text can either be a real position, or:

          MUIV_BetterString_Insert_BufferPos
          MUIV_BetterString_Insert_StartOfLine
          MUIV_BetterString_Insert_EndOfLine


        If there isn't enough room to fit the complete string, then it will be
        truncated, and the user will get a DisplayBeep().
        If the cursor is to the right if the insertion place, then it will be
        moved.

    RESULT
        NONE
