BetterString is a string gadget replacement for Amiga systems. It is created for MUI,
so using it should eliminate the problems with the original BOOPSI string class.
The class offers the user to do number arithmetic, like increase, decrease and
bin to  hex conversion. It has filename completion, ability to mark, cut, copy
and paste text - Both via mouse and keyboard. The length of the contents
buffer will dynamically be expanded to hold all of what the user type (unless
a maximum length is given)

It is used by a wide range of well-known MUI-based application like [YAM](https://github.com/jens-maus/yam)
or [SimpleMail](https://github.com/sba1/simplemail) as the main string gadget.

BetterString.mcc is available for AmigaOS3, AmigaOS4, MorphOS and AROS.
