50.3 (20-Nov-2007)
 - Increased optimisation and some code cleanup
 - Improved the decoder system somewhat
 - Added 2-bit g723 support to the g72x decoder (no idea if this works or not)
 - Also removed some g72x code that wasn't being used (encoders and some alaw/
   ulaw stuff)

50.2 (15-Aug-06)
 - Improved low memory handling. now tries to allocate a smaller decode/encode
   buffer if there isn't enough free memory for the default size (~16kB).
   Previous versions just returned an error if this was the case
 - Fixed saved size of "data" chunk (DTM_WRITE) for stereo sounds. the code
   didn't multiply totalFrames with numChannels so stereo sound files written by
   the datatype were half their original length when loaded back in

50.1 (27-Feb-2006)
 - enabled G.72X support (untested)

0.11 (24-Jan-2006)
 - removed (now) redundant makefile (Makefile.nogsm)
 - fixed bug in 64-bit float decoder (pointer was incremented by 4 instead of
   8...)
 - fixed PPC inline asm in endian.h write_lexx routines (source and destination
   registers were wrong), used in DTM_WRITE

0.10 (22-Nov-2005)
 - added missing signed->unsigned conversion to DTM_WRITE (saving in native
   format should work OK now)
 - added workaround for sounds that have a much too small total frames count in
   their fact chunk
 - removed some useless junk from the code

0.9 (10-Nov-2005)
 - fixed ms adpcm support, finally!! :-D
 - GetWave() now obtains it's file handle properly with DTA_Handle tag instead
   of IDOS->Open()

0.8 (21-Sep-2005)
 - optimised wave_gsm610.c and wave_ieee_float.c a little
 - added option to compile without gsm support (make -f Makefile.nogsm)
 - wave_ms_adpcm.c still not working correctly :-(

0.7 (1-Apr-2005)
 - added 64-bit float support
 - fixed crashes in gsm decoder (wave_gsm610.c)

0.6 (23-Mar-2005):
 - fixed bug in bitpack_seek (bitpack.c)
 - rewrote the decoder system (again) and moved most of it to decoders.c from
   wave_class.c.
 - added GSM610 support

0.5 (6-Mar-2005):
 - no more mysterious "Error 1" error returns!
 - major rewrite of + optimisations to ConvertWAVE() fmt chunk handling...
 - added support for writing in the dt's native format
 - some minor code fixes that I can't remember
 - switched to VBCC

0.3 (28-Feb-2005):
 - added MS ADPCM support (not working)
 - added u-Law A-Law support
 - added IEEE float support
 - minor code fixes (error messages etc.)
 - fixed possible memory trashing (IMA decoder)

0.2 (22-Feb-2005):
 - fixed bug in IMA ADPCM decoder (stereo sounds weren't loaded correctly)

0.1 (21-Feb-2005):
 - first released version of the datatype
