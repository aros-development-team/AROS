   NAME
       anim.datatype -- data type for IFF ANIM animations

   SUPERCLASS
       animation.datatype

   DESCRIPTION
       The anim datatype, a sub-class of the animation.datatype, is used to
       load and play IFF anim animations.
       It supports all currently defined IFF anim compressions
       (0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/J) and any "interleave count".
       ILBM BODY Interleaved bitmaps can be uncompressed or compressed using
       cmpByteRun1.
       Using the prefs-file, any sound can be attached to the animation.

   METHODS
       OM_NEW -- Create a new animation object from a description file. The
           source may be a file or a clipboard unit, both given as an
           IFFHandle, or you may create an empty object (DTST_RAM).

       OM_DISPOSE -- Dispose instance and contents (frames, colormaps, sounds
           etc.), then pass msg to superclass.

       OM_UPDATE -- Perform an ICM_CHECKLOOP check, and if succesfull, the
           method will be executed like OM_SET downstairs.

       OM_SET -- Pass msg to superclass and call GM_RENDER if retval from
           superclass was != 0UL.

       DTM_WRITE -- Save object's contents in local (IFF ANIM-3) or
           superclass (IFF ILBM) format.

       ADTM_START -- Start playback.

       ADTM_PAUSE -- Pause playback.

       ADTM_STOP -- Stop playback.

       ADTM_LOADFRAME -- Fill in struct adtFrame with requested information
           from internal FrameNode list like bitmap, colormap and sample. If
           the bitmap information is not loaded yet, it will be loaded from
           disk.

       ADTM_UNLOADFRAME -- Free resources obtained by ADTM_UNLOADFRAME.

       All other methods are passed unchanged to superclass.

   ATTRIBUTES
       Following attributes are set by the object and are READ-ONLY for
       applications:
       DTA_ObjName             -- set by anim file (IFF generic NAME chunk)
       DTA_ObjAuthor           -- set by anim file (IFF generic AUTH chunk)
       DTA_ObjAnnotation       -- set by anim file (IFF generic ANNO chunk)
       DTA_ObjCopyright        -- set by anim file (IFF generic (C)  chunk)
       DTA_ObjVersion          -- set by anim file (IFF generic FVER chunk)
       DTA_TotalVert           -- set by BitMapHeader (ILBM BMHD chunk)
       DTA_TotalHoriz          -- set by BitMapHeader (ILBM BMHD chunk)
       ADTA_Width              -- set by BitMapHeader (ILBM BMHD chunk)
       ADTA_Height             -- set by BitMapHeader (ILBM BMHD chunk)
       ADTA_Depth              -- set by BitMapHeader (ILBM BMHD chunk)
       ADTA_Frames             -- number of frames in animation
       ADTA_FramesPerSecond    -- FPS rate (possibly set by DPAN chunk)
       ADTA_KeyFrame           -- Key frame of animation

   BUGS
       - In large videos, the frames at the end will be played slower than
         those at the beginning of the file. This is the result of the
         sequential search internally used (only serious with more than 25000
         frames (mc6030/50mhz)).
         May or may not be fixed.

       - Animations with more than 8 planes will crash the system
         (anim.datatype handels 12 bit animations, but animation.datatype 
         V40 handles only anims with a depth of 8).

       - ANIM-1-Code has been disabled because it draws the blocks to X and H
         dimensions which are divisible by 8 (can't be fixed: no test files).

       - The ANHD (AnimHeader) ah_Mask-field will be ignored for ANIM-0,
         2,3,4,5,6,7,8,J. ANIM-1 (acmpXORILBM) respects this.

       - The BMHD (BitMapHeader) bmh_Masking-field will be ignored.

       - ANIM-4 isn' tested yet (no test files).

       - ANIM-4 has been disabled for the reason above.

       - ANIM-J is twice as slow as it should be because ANIM-J operates on
         interleaved bitmaps, but (currently) anim.datatype uses
         non-interleaved bitmaps internally. Therefore the current
         implementation interleaves the bitmap, then unpacks, then
         de-interleaves the bitmap. Not very efficient.

       - Any flags in the ANHD (AnimHeader) ah_Flags field except ahfLongData
         (bit 0; used by Anim-7/8) and ahfXOR (bit 1; used for all
         compression types except ANIM-J (not required, ANIM-J has an
         internal XOR mode) and anim-0) are ignored. ANIM-4 suffers under
         these problems (cannot be fixed without example files).

       - ANIM-6 left/right channels are viewed interleaved. Upon request,
         I can add options to view the left or right channel only.

       - The internal "rollback" machanism used for creating full images from
         given DLTAs is slow. This is caused by implementation details,
         not the idea itself.

       - If an animations contains colormaps-per-frame and the given CMAP
         contains less colors than (1UL << anim_depth), the remaining colors
         are filled with black. I don't know where to take the remaining
         colors (from last frame/previous (e.g. interleaved) frame)...
         Comments __VERY__ welcome.

       - The ANIM-3 encoder has a slight problem in run-length compression;
         therefore this part has been disabled.

       - The encoder does not support dynamic timing properly. Instead,
         all frames are saved.

       - The encoded initial ANIM-3 IFF ILBM BODY is uncompressed.

       - The encoder rejects any attempt to work with non-planar or
         interleaved planar bitmaps.

   TODO
       - Fixing the bugs above.

       - Internal cache for packed DLTA chunks. This may speed up the
         internal rollback mechanism used for random frame access.

       - Other compression formats when saving, including the popular
         ANIM-5.

       - PERIOD options to modify the given sound.

       - Add support for animation.datatype V41 ADTA_TicksPerFrame timing.

       - Write the "--input_format--"-Autodoc section.

   HISTORY
       V1.1
         Released to the Waldspecht-BBS for testing.

       V1.2
         Released to the Waldspecht-BBS for testing.

       V1.3
         Released to the Waldspecht-BBS for testing.

       V1.4
         First Aminet release.

         - Partial code cleanup

         - Recompiled with SAS/C 6.57.

         - Redirected serial "verbose" output to a CON:-window, including
           the matching VERBOSE prefs option.

         - Changed the VERBOSE output a little bit.

       V1.5
         - Implemented palette per frame (ILBM CMAPs per frame).
           (animation.datatype 40.7 does not support these colormap changes
           per frame (it's output may look like a color trash). Custom
           animation players which uses animation.datatype subclasses for
           loading (like my DBufDTAnim) don't have this problem.
           animation.datatype will support these colormaps-per-frame in one
           of the next updates.)

         - Internal changes to be able to support up to 12 planes in an anim.
           The animation.datatype 40.7 supports only anims up to 8 planes,
           otherwise the machine will crash. My animation.datatype V41 will
           support this.

         - The generic IFF ANNO, AUTH, FVER, NAME and "(C) " chunks are now
           moved to the corresponsing DataTypes attributes if they appear in
           a FORM ILBM.
           The data will be moved like this:
           ANNO -> DTA_ObjAnnotation
           AUTH -> DTA_ObjAuthor
           FVER -> DTA_ObjVersion
           NAME -> DTA_ObjName
           (C)  -> DTA_ObjCopyright

         - DTA_Title equals now to DTA_ObjName (e.g. a given NAME chunk). If
           this is NULL, DTA_Name is used instead.

         - If a DPAN (DPaint Anim) chunk occurs, the FPS rate is taken from
           the "flags" field.
           Thanks to Brian Jones (bjones@cadvision.com) for reporting this.
           If the value taken is 0, the old, fixed rate (5 fps) is used
           again.

         - Fixed a hole in the state machine which causes problems when an
           animation contains no frames. Should work now.
           Fixed.

         - An error in the prefs-file will now force the VERBOSE option.

         - Implemented sound. A sample can now be attached to the animation
           using the SAMPLE/VERBOSE options.
           Note that anim.datatype is still a GID_ANIMATION (anim WITHOUT
           sound) type datatype.
           The GID_#? idetifiers belongs to the source data, not the
           modifications done by a datatype code (a IFF ANIM does not contain
           any sound data, the sound is attached later).

       V1.6
         - Disabled the optimizer. This fixes a mysterious System-Crash
           when resizing the parent application window. Don't know why this
           works now :-((

       V1.7
         - Reorganisation of source (includes small cleanup).

         - Fixed a silly hole in the state machine which causes the
           datatype to return errors on colormap changes (e.g. ILBM CMAPs).
           Error codes were returned like this:
           (Number_of_colors_in_CMAP * 3).

         - Enabled the optimizer (see V1.6) again. Since reorganisation of
           the src, the problem never occured again. Any hint ?

         - Fixed a bug in LibExpunge (didn't check lib_OpenCnt), which is
           also present in all my other external BOOSI classes (and
           datatypes).
           Thanks to Guenter Niki (gniki@informatik.uni-rostok.de) for
           reporting this bug.

       V1.8
         * Shareware
           Starting with V1.8, anim.datatype is Shareware.

         - Added experimental stack swapping code. The "Need more stack"-
           requester has been removed for this reason.
           This also fixes a possible deadlock of "input.device" because
           the GM_LAYOUT method was running with low stack.

         - Uses OpenFromLock when obtaining a fh for random frame access.
           This allows the usage of "virtual filesystems" (datatypes.library
           V45 allows such things).

         - Now supports saving in the local format (e.g. IFF ANIM,
           currently only ANIM-3).
           Note that saveing begins with the __current__ frame and can be
           controlled with the ADTA_Frame, ADTA_Frames and
           ADTA_FrameIncrement attributes.

         - Now support DTST_RAM (creates an empty anim.datatype object).

         - Now supports subclasses of anim.datatype, mainly to fill in
           the ADTM_LOADFRAME/ADTM_UNLOADFRAME methods when using an empty
           (e.g. created with DTST_RAM) anim.datatype object.

         - Now the high order bits of each color gun are replicated through
           the whole INT32 in the colormap.

       V1.9
         - Fixed a bug which prevents saving in local (IFF ANIM-3) format
           using an (created using DTST_RAM) empty object (like "DTConvert"
           does).
           Fixed.

       V1.10
         - Moved IFF ANIM defines etc. to classdata.h include file.

         - Reworked file scan. This fixes problems with many animations
           where the second frame was treated as an ILBM instead of an DLTA.
           Fixed.

         - Implemented ADTM_START, ADTM_STOP and ADTM_PAUSE to get a more
           smoothly start and stop, see method autodocs for details.

         - Implemented Martin Tailefer's AsyncIO code (currenty broken,
           has been disabled for now).

         - Removed unnecessary GM_LAYOUT code; DTA_Total(Vert|Horiz) are now
           set in OM_NEW.

         - Fixed ADTM_LOADFRAME that if a frame can't be loaded (seek error,
           or timestamp not found) now a matching error code will be
           returned in Result2.

         - Removed NOREMAP feature and matching DTM_FRAMEBOX code because
           this was an ugly hack...

         - XORBitMap has been rewritten, XOR mode for
           ANIM-2/-3/-4/-5/-6/-7-/8 should now be a little bit faster;
           this also fixes two bugs:
           - The bitmaps were incorrectly merged together when the bitmap
             size grows over 64k per plane (for example 1280 * 512)
             Fixed.
           - Due rounding errors the last 8 pixels were not processed
             Fixed.

         - Plane pointers are now on a quad-long boundary to get more speed
           on a mc68040.

         - Internal CopyBitMap has been optimized to use CopyMemQuick if
           possible.

         - Added compatibility code for DPaint ANIM Brushes, compressed with
           ANIM-5 and XOR mode, but which don't have the XOR bit set.
           Added NODPAINTBRUSHPATCH to disable this function.
           This fixes the problems with the animations I found in the CanDo
           distribution.

         - Added support for GRAB chunk (grabbing point of animation).
           Does only work with animation.datatype V41 (which implements
           PDTA_Grab attribute).

         - Stack swapping code has been improved; the stack is now only
           swapped if stacksize falls below 16384 / 2 bytes; this saves
           the stack allocation for ADTM_LOADFRAME / ADTM_UNLOADFRAME
           in animation.datatype V41.

         - Added WaitBlit in OM_DISPOSE to wait for blitter which may
           use our bitmaps.

         - Added seperate memory pool for frame bitmaps, which is
           set up to have the correct size for this job.
           This should speed up bitmap memory allocations.
           The pool's size is reduced if there is not enougth memory.
           The other "misc usage" pool is increased to 32k get the
           correct size for DLTA temp mem usage.
           The datatype now uses AllocVecPooled instead of AllocVec
           for delta buffers.

         - Cut some chars from the AnimHeader dump output. Now it fits
           on a single-line in a 640 pixel CON: window (topaz 8 font).

         - Added NOLOADALL and CMAPS switch for multi-line prefs using
           the MATCHPROJECT option.

         - Added additional checking code for CAMG chunk data. Invalid
           flags are now removed.

         - Added support for dynamic timing, e.g. anim.datatype now uses
           AnimHeader's ah_AbsTime and ah_RelTime fields. Does only work
           properly with animation.datatype V41 (for animation.datatype
           V40 this option is turned off per default and turned on if
           superclass is animation.datatype V41); matching NODYNAMICTIMING
           and DYNAMICTIMING options have been added; modifications
           have been made in AttachSamples and ADTM_LOADFRAME, too.

         - Fixed the bug that the last sample's length wasn't calculated
           correctly, which may have caused Enforcer read-hits (never
           seen, but...).

         - Added SAMPLESPERFRAME option to override own calculations.
           This allows to get rid of rounding errors in such cases.

         - Added "wanted" message for IFF ANIM-4 animations. If you have
           such an animation, and if you are the FIRST who send's me a VALID
           IFF ANIM-4 compressed animation, you'll get $10. No joke.

         - ANIM-3 encoder has been cut down in functionality to get
           (temporary) rid of a bug in run-length encoding (DPaint IV AGA
           does not like this !?).

         - The encoder does not not fail if a subclass returns
           ERROR_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND for ADTM_LOADFRAME. It simply tries
           to load the next frame. This fixes some problems with dynamic
           timing.

         - The encoder now checks explicitly for non-planar or interleaved
           planar input bitmaps, which are NOT supported yet (e.g.
           such an attempt results in ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED).

         - A fps value greater than 60 fps found in a DPAN chunk is now
           treated as invalid.

       V1.11
         - Recompiled with SAS/C 6.58. May fix some mc68060 related
           problems.

         - Found the longstanding bug that animation.datatype V40.7
           didn't free some frames. Reason is that ADTM_LOADFRAME
           may be used like "realloc". Now alf_UserData is checked;
           any given frame will be freed (ADTM_UNLOADFRAME).
           Fixed.

         - ADTM_UNLOADFRAME now clears alf_UserData to indicate that the
           frame has been freed.

         - Now supports anims deeper than 8 planes, but a colormap
           (e.g. a CMAP chunk) is still expected.

         - Fixed the bug that a free of the current frame caused an frame
           to be not freed. (The idea was to hold the current frame for
           following delta accesses; this has been replaced by the idea
           of the "posted free").

         - Implemented the idea of a "posted free". For delta accesses,
           it's not very usefull to free the frame when the next frame
           needs it for it's delta access. Therefore, the anim.datatype
           now manages a "free list", where the free of the previous
           and the previous-previous frame will be posted until
           it is really not longer in use.

         - Fixed a bug in the LOADALL mode that the wrong previous
           frame was used (due a change in V1.10).

         - The single framenodes now caches a pointer to their previous
           frame. This should speed up loading a little bit.

         - If an animation has dynamic timing and the superclass
           (animation.datatype) has the ADTA_AdaptiveFPS flag set,
           the playback speed now defaults to 60 fps.

         - Saved an AllocVecPooled in ADTM_LOADFRAME by merging multiple
           delta buffer allocations to one allocation (which can hold the
           largest delta).

         - The stack swapping code now allocates it's memory without
           the MEMF_CLEAR flags, which should speed up things.

         - Removed BestModeIDA code, because animation.datatype does
           the same.

         - The options setting for DPaint brush compatibility patch
           worked wrong (the order was wrong). Now the options
           work as described.
           Fixed.

         - Fixed a bug in the encoder that the last color of a dynamic
           pallete as not copied (GetRGB32 got numcolors - 1 instead
           of numcolors).
           Fixed.

       V1.12
         - Replaced the custom stack swapping code by my "standard" module.

         - Now the default FPS rate is 10 if animation.datatype is
           < V41. If V41 is running with ADTA_AdaptiveFPS, the
           fps is set to 60.

         - Fixed ModeID handling. The previous behaviour was that
           a 0 mode id causes the datatype to select it's own mode id.
           But 0 means LORES. Now the default is -1 (which means
           INVALID_ID), which causes the datatype to do it's own
           calculations.
           Fixed.

         - OM_DISPOSE now preserves Result2 (IoErr()) to avoid that an 
           error code may get lost.

   NOTES
       This datatype first scans the whole animation to get index
       information (if the LOADALL switch was set in the prefs-file,
       the entire animation will be loaded), colormaps will be loaded
       immediately.

anim.datatype/ADTM_LOADFRAME                     anim.datatype/ADTM_LOADFRAME

    NAME
        ADTM_LOADFRAME -- Load frame

    FUNCTION
        The ADTM_LOADFRAME method is used to obtain the bitmap and timing
        data of the animation.
        The given timestamp will be used to find a matching timestamp
        in the internal FrameNode list. If it was found, the corresponding
        timing, bitmap and colormap data are stored into the struct
        adtFrame. If the bitmap wasn't loaded at this time, this method 
        attempts to load it from disk.

    RESULT
        Returns the bitmap ptr if a bitmap was found, 0UL otherwise;
        in case of failure Result2 contains the cause:
        ERROR_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND: Given timestamp does not exist
        ERROR_NO_FREE_STORE:    No memory
        and so on...

    NOTE
        It is expected that a 0 return code (error) causes an
        ADTM_UNLOADFRAME that the invalid bitmap etc. will be freed.

anim.datatype/ADTM_PAUSE                             anim.datatype/ADTM_PAUSE

    NAME
        ADTM_PAUSE -- Pause playback

    FUNCTION
        ADTM_PAUSE tells the subclass (use) to pause playback.

        The method is passed to animation.datatype first, which pauses the
        playback clock.

    RESULT
        Returns result from superclass (animation.datatype)

    NOTE

anim.datatype/ADTM_START                             anim.datatype/ADTM_START

    NAME
        ADTM_START -- Prepare for playback

    FUNCTION
        ADTM_START tells the subclass (us) to prepare for continous
        playback. To avoid a long "search" for a full frame during the
        playback clock is running, we load here the given timestamp
        (asa_Frame) manually (and preseves it using a small trick, see
        source).

        After all, the method is passed to superclass, which starts the
        playback (and the master clock).

    RESULT
        Returns result from superclass (animation.datatype)

    NOTE

anim.datatype/ADTM_STOP                               anim.datatype/ADTM_STOP

    NAME
        ADTM_STOP -- Stop playback

    FUNCTION
        ADTM_STOP tells the subclass (use) to stop playback.

        The method is passed to animation.datatype first, which stops the
        playback clock.

        After clock has been stopped, we search for frames which have a
        0 UseCount and have not been unloaded yet (a small cleaup to get
        rid of frames which are loaded using the "trick" in ADTM_START
        code).

    RESULT
        Returns result from superclass (animation.datatype)

    NOTE

anim.datatype/ADTM_UNLOADFRAME                 anim.datatype/ADTM_UNLOADFRAME

    NAME
        ADTM_UNLOADFRAME -- Load frame contents

    FUNCTION
        The ADTM_UNLOADFRAME method is used to release the contents of a
        animation frame.

        This method frees the bitmap data found in adtFrame.

    RESULT
        Returns always 0UL.

anim.datatype/DTM_WRITE                               anim.datatype/DTM_WRITE

    NAME
        DTM_WRITE -- Save data

    FUNCTION
        This method saves the object's contents to disk.

        If dtw_Mode is DTWM_IFF, the method is passed unchanged to the
        superclass, animation.datatype, which writes a single IFF ILBM
        picture.

        If dtw_mode is DTWM_RAW, the object saved an IFF ANIM stream to
        the filehandle given, starting with the current frame until
        the end is reached.
        The sequence saved can be controlled by the ADTA_Frame, ADTA_Frames
        and ADTA_FrameIncrement attributes (see TAGS section below).

    TAGS
        When writing the local ("raw") format, IFF ANIM, the following
        attributes are recognized:

        ADTA_Frame (ULONG) - start frame, saving starts here.
            Defaults to the current frame displayed.

        ADTA_Frames (ULONG) - the number of frames to be saved,
            Defaults to (max_num_of_frames - curr_frame).

        ADTA_FrameIncrement (ULONG) - frame increment when saving.
            Defaults to 1, which means: "jump to next frame".

    NOTE
        - Any sound attached to the animation will NOT be saved.

        - A CTRL-D signal to the writing process aborts the save.

    RESULT
        Returns 0 for failure (IoErr() returns result2), non-zero
        for success.

    REQUIREMENTS
        - You need at least Kick/WB 3.0.
          | Many people wrote me that they cannot find an
          | "animation.datatype" class.
          | Only the 3.1 release contains it. (Subclasses of)
          | animation.datatype can run under 3.0.

        - "datatypes/animation.datatype", >= V39.
          "animation.datatype 40.7 (28.09.93)" requires itself some
          libraries/boopsi classes:
        - "realtime.library", >= V39              - for timing
        - "gadgets/tapedeck.gadget" (any version) - for the controls

           If you want to attach samples, you need "sound.datatype" >= V39
           and your prefereed subclass (8svx.datatype for IFF 8SVX samples
           etc.).

    USAGE
        If the datatypes descriptor file was activated, any attempt to load
        an IFF anim stream using GMultiView, MultiView, AmigaGuide or
        SwitchWindow will load and play the animation. If the source was a
        file, anim.datatype loads frames dynamically from disk, if the
        source was the clipboard, anim.datatype caches the whole anim.

        anim.datatype supports also the clipboard as input, e.g.
        "MultiView CLIPBOARD", ClipView or SwitchWindow are able to show
        IFF ANIMs from clipboard.

        If you want to save the current animation in anim.datatype's local
        format, use MultiView's "Project/Save As..." menu (or GMultiView's
        "Project/Save As Raw...").
        anim.datatype saves the current animation, stating with the current
        frame as IFF ANIM-3.
        Other compression formats such as ANIM-0/1/2/4/5/7/8/J will
        be implemeted later.

        If you want to attach samples to the animation, you must edit the
        prefs file (ENV:Classes/DataTypes/anim.prefs) and add the following
        line:
        VERBOSE SAMPLE="ram:have_a_nice_day.8svx"
        Which loads and attaches the sample "ram:have_a_nice_day.8svx" to the
        animation. See anim.datatype.doc/preferences for a complete
        description of the prefs file.

    INSTALLATION
        After unpacking this archive:
        Because this version does not include an Installer script, you have
        to do the installation manually through the shell:

          - Unpack this archive and copy the "anim.datatype" to
            SYS:Classes/DataTypes:

     Copy CLONE FROM "anim.datatype" TO "SYS:Classes/DataTypes/anim.datatype"

          - Then copy the datatypes descriptor into the DEVS:DataTypes
            directory.
            If the descriptor already exists, you should not replace it,
            otherwise you may loose "toolnodes" and other settings stored in
            the existing descriptor.

     Copy CLONE FROM "ANIM(%|.info)" TO DEVS:Datatypes/

    SOURCE
        Partial source is included as an example how to write an
        animation.datatype subclass which deals with things like
        "delta-compression" techniques.

anim.datatype/OM_DISPOSE                             anim.datatype/OM_DISPOSE

    NAME
        OM_DISPOSE -- Delete a anim.datatype object.

    FUNCTION
        The OM_DISPOSE method is used to delete an instance of the
        anim.datatype class. This method is passed to the superclass when
        it has completed.
        This method frees all frame nodes and their contents (bitmaps,
        colormaps, samples etc.)

    RESULT
        The object is deleted. 0UL is returned.

anim.datatype/OM_NEW                                     anim.datatype/OM_NEW

    NAME
        OM_NEW -- Create a anim.datatype object.

    FUNCTION
        The OM_NEW method is used to create an instance of the anim.datatype
        class.  This method is passed to the superclass first. After this,
        anim.datatype parses the prefs file and makes a scan through
        the data to get index information. Frame bitmaps are loaded if the
        input stream isn't seekable (e.g. IFF handle/clipboard),
        colormaps and the first frame are loaded immediately.
        If a sample was set in the prefs, it will be loaded and attached
        to the animation.

    ATTRIBUTES
        The following attributes can be specified at creation time.

        DTA_SourceType (ULONG) -- Determinates the type of DTA_Handle
            attribute. DTST_FILE, DTST_CLIPBOARD and DTST_RAM are supported.
            If any other type was set in a given DTA_SourceType,
            OM_NEW will be rejected.
            A sourcetype of DTST_CLIPBOARD forces the LOADALL prefs
            switch (can't seek on clipboard).
            Defaults to DTST_FILE.

        DTA_Handle -- For both DTST_FILE and DTST_CLIPBOARD, a
            (struct IFFHandle *) is expected. This handle will be
            created by datatypesclass depeding on the DTF_#? flag, which
            is DTF_IFF here.  DTST_FILE, datatypesclass creates
            a IFF handle from the given DTA_Name and DTA_Handle (a
            BPTR returned by Lock), if DTST_CLIPBOARD, datatypesclass
            passes the given (IFF) handle through.
            A DTST_RAM (create empty object) source type requires a NULL
            handle.

    RESULT
        If the object was created a pointer to the object is returned,
        otherwise NULL is returned.

anim.datatype/preferences                           anim.datatype/preferences

   NAME
       preferences

   DESCRIPTION
       The "ENV:Classes/DataTypes/anim.prefs" file contains global
       settings for the datatype.
       The preferences file is an ASCII file containing one line where the
       preferences can be set.
       It can be superset by a local variable with the same name.

       Each line can contain settings, special settings for some projects
       can be set using the MATCHPROJECT option.
       Lines beginning with a '#' or ';' chars are treated as comments.
       Lines are limitted to 256 chars.

   TEMPLATE
       MATCHPROJECT/K,VERBOSE/S,MODEID/K/N,CMAPS/S,NOCMAPS/S,
       DPAINTBRUSHPATCH/S,NODPAINTBRUSHPATCH/S,FPS/K/N,DYNAMICTIMING/S,
       NODYNAMICTIMING/S,SAMPLE/K,SAMPLESPERFRAME=SPF/K/N,VOLUME/K/N,
       LOADALL/S,NOLOADALL/S

       MATCHPROJECT -- The settings in this line belongs only to this
           project(s), e.g. if the case-insensitive pattern does not match,
           this line is ignored.
           The maximum length of the pattern is 128 chars.
           Defaults to #?, which matches any project.

       VERBOSE -- Print information about the animation. Currently
          the frame numbers and the used compression are printed, after all
          number of scanned/loaded frames, set FPS rate, dimensions (width/
          height/depth), sample information etc.

       MODEID -- Select screen mode id of datatype (will be stored in
           ADTA_ModeID). Note that the DOS ReadArgs function used for parsing
           fetches a SIGNED long. The bit 31 will be represented by minus
           '-'. (example: "MODEID=266240" sets the mode to the A2024 screen
           mode id)
           Defaults to 0, which means: Use the screen mode from CAMG chunk,
           if missing use the best screenmode available for the given width,
           height and depth.

       CMAPS -- Use colormaps per frame. This switch is set per default,
           and can be turned off by the NOCMAPS option, later it can be
           turned on again by this option.

       NOCMAPS -- Don't load/use colormaps per frame. Only the initial
           colormap will be used.
           The current version of animation.datatype (V40.7 (28.09.93)) does
           not implement per frame colormaps, it's output may look trashed.
           Custom players like "DBufDTAnim" does support
           "per frame colormaps",
           animation.datatype V41 will implement "per frame colormaps".

       DPAINTBRUSHPATCH -- If frames of ANIM-5 with an interleave of 1
           occurs, the XOR mode is forced, even if the XOR bit is not set.
           This fixes problems with some DPaint brush animations.
           This option is ON per default and can be turned off by the 
           NODPAINTBRUSHPATCH option.

       NODPAINTBRUSHPATCH -- Turns off the DPaint brush patch. See 
           DPAINTBRUSHPATCH option for details.

       FPS -- Frames Per Second
           Defaults to FPS set by DPAN chunk. If the DPAN chunk is missing
           a fixed 5 fps rate is used.
           A value of 0 here means: Use default FPS.

       DYNAMICTIMING -- Turns dynamic timing on. Default if superclass
           is animation.datatype V41, otherwise this option must
           be explicitly set.

       NODYNAMICTIMING -- Turn dynamic timing off. Default if superclass
           is animation.datatype < V41 (e.g. V40.6).

       SAMPLE -- Attach the given sample to the animation. The sample will
           be loaded using datatypes (GID_SOUND).
           Only one sample can be attached to one animationstream, any
           following attempt to attach a sample will be ignored.

       SAMPLESPERFRAME -- Set samples per frame rate for sound. This
           overrides the own internal calculations to get rid of rounding
           errors.

       VOLUME -- Volume of the sound when playing.
           Defaults to 64, which is the maximum. A value greater than 64 will
           be set to 64.

       LOADALL -- Load all frames into memory. If the source input is a
           clipboard, this option is always set.

       NOLOADALL -- Turns off the LOADALL flag, which may be set in a prefs-
           line before. This switch is set per default, and can be turned off
           by the LOADALL option, later it can be turned on again by this
           option.

       REGISTERED -- Turns off the shareware notice requester.

   NOTE
       An invalid prefs file line will be ignored and forces the VERBOSE
       output.

   BUGS
       - Low memory may cause that the prefs file won't be parsed.

       - Lines are limitted to 256 chars

       - An invalid prefs file line will be ignored.

       - The sample path length is limitted to 200 chars. A larger
         value may crash the machine if an error occurs.
