picture.datatype is an external class. So it has only very few
functions: some library-support and the class-dispatcher.
But the methods and properties of the class must be written.
As a first step picture.datatype will be developed for a very
special environment: AROS datatypes.library, AROS ppm.datatype,
AROS Multiview.
When it runs in this env it will be generalized.
The following items must be implemented:

library-framework               100% done
documentation                   Hey, I am a programmer, not an author ;)
dispatcher-function             100% done

methods:                        
    OM_NEW			80% done
    OM_DISPOSE			80% done
    OM_UPDATE			part of OM_SET
    OM_SET			90% done
    OM_GET			90% done
