   NAME
	CloseAsync -- close an async file.

   SYNOPSIS
	success = CloseAsync( file );
	  d0                   a0

	LONG CloseAsync( struct AsyncFile * );

   FUNCTION
	Closes a file, flushing any pending writes. Once this call has been
	made, the file can no longer be accessed.

   INPUTS
	file - the file to close. May be NULL, in which case this function
	       returns -1 and sets the IoErr() code to ERROR_INVALID_LOCk.

   RESULT
	result - < 0 for an error, >= 0 for success. Indicates whether closing
	    the file worked or not. If the file was opened in read-mode,
	    then this call will always work. In case of error,
		dos.library/IoErr() can give more information.

asyncio/FGetsAsync                                         asyncio/FGetsAsync

   NAME
	FGetsAsync -- read a line from an async file, fgets-style.

   SYNOPSIS
	buffer = FGetsAsync( file, buffer, size );
	  d0                  a0     a1     d0

	APTR ReadLineAsync( struct AsyncFile *, APTR, LONG );

   FUNCTION
	This function reads a single line from an async file, stopping at
	either a NEWLINE character or EOF. In either event, UP TO the
	number of size specified bytes minus 1 will be copied into the
	buffer. It returns the number of bytes put into the buffer,
	excluding the null-termination. 0 indicates EOF, and -1 indicates
	read error.

        If terminated by a newline, the newline WILL be the last character in
        the buffer. The string read in IS null-terminated.

   INPUTS
	file - opened file to read from, as obtained from OpenAsync()
	buffer - buffer to read the line into.
	size - size of the buffer, in bytes.

   RESULT
	buffer - Pointer to buffer passed in, or NULL for immediate EOF or
	    for an error. If NULL is returned for EOF, then
	    dos.library/IoErr() returns 0.

	buffer - buffer to read the line into.
	size - size of the buffer, in bytes.
	length - pointer to ULONG to hold the length of the line, excluding
	    the terminating null.

   RESULT
	buffer - Pointer to buffer passed in, or NULL for immediate EOF or
	    for an error. If NULL is returned for EOF, then
	    dos.library/IoErr() returns 0.

   NAME
	OpenAsync -- open a file for asynchronous IO.

   SYNOPSIS
	file = OpenAsync( fileName, accessMode, bufferSize
	 d0                  a0         d0          d1
	                                       [, sysbase, dosbase ] );
	                                            a1       a2

	struct AsyncFile *OpenAsync( const STRPTR, LONG, LONG
	                   [, struct ExecBase *, struct DosLibrary * ] );

	file = OpenAsyncFromFH( handle, accessMode, bufferSize
	                          a0        d0          d1
	                                       [, sysbase, dosbase ] );
	                                            a1       a2

	struct AsyncFile *OpenAsyncFromFH( BPTR, LONG, LONG
	                   [, struct ExecBase *, struct DosLibrary * ] );

   FUNCTION
	The named file is opened and an async file handle returned. If the
	accessMode is MODE_READ, an existing file is opened for reading.
	If accessMode is MODE_WRITE, a new file is created for writing. If
	a file of the same name already exists, it is first deleted. If
	accessMode is MODE_APPEND, an existing file is prepared for writing.
	Data written is added to the end of the file. If the file does not
	exists, it is created.

	'fileName' is a filename and CANNOT be a window specification such as
	CON: or RAW:, or "*"

	'bufferSize' specifies the size of the IO buffer to use. There are
	in fact two buffers allocated, each of roughly (bufferSize/2) bytes
	in size. The actual buffer size use can vary slightly as the size
	is rounded to speed up DMA.

	If the file cannot be opened for any reason, the value returned
	will be NULL, and a secondary error code will be available by
	calling the routine dos.library/IoErr().

    INPUTS
	name - name of the file to open, cannot be a window specification
	accessMode - one of MODE_READ, MODE_WRITE, or MODE_APPEND
	bufferSize - size of IO buffer to use. 8192 is recommended as it
	    provides very good performance for relatively little memory.
	sysbase - Library base needed for the "no externals" version of the
	    library.
	dosbase - Library base, as sysbase.

    RESULTS
	file - an async file handle or NULL for failure. You should not access
	    the fields in the AsyncFile structure, these are private to the
	    async IO routines. In case of failure, dos.library/IoErr() can
	    give more information.

    NOTES (by MH)
	Although stated that CON:, RAW:, or "*" cannot be used as the file
	name, tests indicates that the 2.0+ "Console:" volume is safe to
	use for writing (haven't tested reading). No guarantees though.

	Also note that there is no MODE_READWRITE for AsyncIO. You cannot
	read and write to the same AsyncFile.

asyncio/PeekAsync                                           asyncio/PeekAsync

   NAME
	PeekAsync -- read bytes from an async file without advancing file
	    pointer.

   SYNOPSIS
	actualLength = PeekAsync( file, buffer, numBytes );
	     d0                    a0     a1       d0

   FUNCTION
	This function tries to read bytes of information from an opened
	async file into the buffer given. 'numBytes' is the number of bytes
	to read from the file.

	The read is done without advancing the file pointer, and the read
	is limited to what is available in the current buffer (or the next
	buffer, if the current buffer is empty). If the current buffer does
	not contain 'numBytes' bytes, only the bytes left in the buffer is
	read.

	Using PeekAsync() can remove the need to SeekAsync() back after some
	ReadAsync() calls (making your read operations more pipe friendly).

	The value returned is the length of the information actually read.
	So, when 'actualLength' is greater than zero, the value of
	'actualLength' is the the number of characters read. A value of
	zero means that end-of-file has been reached. Errors are indicated
	by a value of -1.

    INPUTS
	file - opened file to read, as obtained from OpenAsync()
	buffer - buffer where to put bytes read
	numBytes - number of bytes to read into buffer

    RESULT
	actualLength - actual number of bytes read, or -1 if an error. In
	    case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information.

asyncio/ReadAsync                                           asyncio/ReadAsync

   NAME
	ReadAsync -- read bytes from an async file.

   SYNOPSIS
	actualLength = ReadAsync( file, buffer, numBytes );
	     d0                    a0     a1       d0

	LONG ReadAsync( struct AsyncFile *, APTR, LONG );

   FUNCTION
	This function reads bytes of information from an opened async file
	into the buffer given. 'numBytes' is the number of bytes to read from
	the file.

	The value returned is the length of the information actually read.
	So, when 'actualLength' is greater than zero, the value of
	'actualLength' is the the number of characters read. Usually
	ReadAsync() will try to fill up your buffer before returning. A value
	of zero means that end-of-file has been reached. Errors are indicated
	by a value of -1.

    INPUTS
	file - opened file to read, as obtained from OpenAsync()
	buffer - buffer where to put bytes read
	numBytes - number of bytes to read into buffer

    RESULT
	actualLength - actual number of bytes read, or -1 if an error. In
	    case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information.

asyncio/ReadCharAsync                                   asyncio/ReadCharAsync

   NAME
	ReadCharAsync -- read a single byte from an async file.

   SYNOPSIS
	byte = ReadCharAsync( file );
	 d0                    a0

	LONG ReadCharAsync( struct AsyncFile * );

   FUNCTION
	This function reads a single byte from an async file. The byte is
	returned, or -1 if there was an error reading, or if the end-of-file
	was reached.

   INPUTS
	file - opened file to read from, as obtained from OpenAsync()

   RESULT
	byte - the byte read, or -1 if no byte was read. In case of error,
	    dos.library/IoErr() can give more information. If IoErr()
	    returns 0, it means end-of-file was reached. Any other value
	    indicates an error.

asyncio/ReadLineAsync                                   asyncio/ReadLineAsync

   NAME
	ReadLineAsync -- read a line from an async file.

   SYNOPSIS
	bytes = ReadLineAsync( file, buffer, size );
	 d0                     a0     a1     d0

	LONG ReadLineAsync( struct AsyncFile *, APTR, ULONG );

   FUNCTION
	This function reads a single line from an async file, stopping at
	either a NEWLINE character or EOF. In either event, UP TO the
	number of size specified bytes minus 1 will be copied into the
	buffer. It returns the number of bytes put into the buffer,
	excluding the null-termination. 0 indicates EOF, and -1 indicates
	read error.

	If the line in the file is longer than the buffer, the line will be
	truncated (any newline will be present). Any data left in the file
	upto the newline will be lost.

	If terminated by a newline, the newline WILL be the last character in
	the buffer. The string read in IS null-terminated.

   INPUTS
	file - opened file to read from, as obtained from OpenAsync()
	buffer - buffer to read the line into.
	size - size of the buffer, in bytes.

   RESULT
	bytes - number of bytes read. In case of error (-1 is returned)
	    dos.library/IoErr() can give more information. EOF is indicated
	    by a return of 0.

asyncio/SeekAsync                                           asyncio/SeekAsync

   NAME
	SeekAsync -- set the current position for reading or writing within
	    an async file.

   SYNOPSIS
	oldPosition = SeekAsync( file, position, mode );
	     d0                   a0      d0      d1

	LONG SeekAsync( struct AsyncFile *, LONG, LONG );

   FUNCTION
	SeekAsync() sets the read/write cursor for the file 'file' to the
	position 'position'. This position is used by the various read/write
	functions as the place to start reading or writing. The result is the
	current absolute position in the file, or -1 if an error occurs, in
	which case dos.library/IoErr() can be used to find more information.
	'mode' can be MODE_START, MODE_CURRENT or MODE_END. It is used to
	specify the relative start position. For example, 20 from current
	is a position 20 bytes forward from current, -20 is 20 bytes back
	from current.

	To find out what the current position within a file is, simply seek
	zero from current.

    INPUTS
	file - an opened async file, as obtained from OpenAsync()
	position - the place where to move the read/write cursor
	mode - the mode for the position, one of MODE_START, MODE_CURRENT,
	    or MODE_END.

    RESULT
	oldPosition - the previous position of the read/write cursor, or -1
	    if an error occurs. In case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can
	    give more information.

    NOTES (by MH)
	If you seek after having read only a few bytes, the function must
	wait for both buffers to be loaded, before the seek can be done.
	This can cause small delays. Note that the above case isn't the
	only one, but the typical one.

   NAME
	WriteAsync -- write data to an async file.

   SYNOPSIS
	actualLength = WriteAsync( file, buffer, numBytes );
	     d0                     a0     a1       d0

	LONG WriteAsync( struct AsyncFile *, APTR, LONG );

   FUNCTION
	WriteAsync() writes bytes of data to an opened async file. 'numBytes'
	indicates the number of bytes of data to be transferred. 'buffer'
	points to the data to write. The value returned is the length of
	information actually written. So, when 'actualLength' is greater
	than zero, the value of 'actualLength' is the number of characters
	written. Errors are indicated by a return value of -1.

    INPUTS
	file - an opened file, as obtained from OpenAsync()
	buffer - address of data to write
	numBytes - number of bytes to write to the file

    RESULT
	actualLength - number of bytes written, or -1 if error. In case
	    of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information.

   SYNOPSIS
	result = WriteCharAsync( file, byte );
	  d0                      a0    d0

	LONG WriteCharAsync( struct AsyncFile *, UBYTE );

   FUNCTION
	This function writes a single byte to an async file.

   INPUTS
	file - an opened async file, as obtained from OpenAsync()
	byte - byte of data to add to the file

   RESULT
	result - 1 if the byte was written, -1 if there was an error. In
	    case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information.

   SYNOPSIS
	bytes = WriteLineAsync( file, buffer );

	LONG WriteLineAsync( struct AsyncFile *, STRPTR );

   FUNCTION
	This function writes an unformatted string to an async file. No
	newline is appended to the string.

   INPUTS
	file - opened file to read from, as obtained from OpenAsync()
	buffer - buffer to write to the file

   RESULT
	bytes - number of bytes written, or -1 if there was an error. In
	    case of error, dos.library/IoErr() can give more information.
