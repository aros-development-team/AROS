/*  FUNCTION
	StrnCmp() will compare two strings, up to a maximum length
	of length using a specific kind of collation information
	according to the locale.

	The result will be less than zero, zero, or greater than zero
	depending upon whether the string string1 is less than, equal
	to, or greater than the string pointed to string2.

    INPUTS
	locale      -   Which locale to use for this comparison.
	string1     -   NULL terminated string.
	string2     -   NULL terminated string.
	length      -   Maximum length of string to compare.
	type        -   How to compare the strings, values are:

	    SC_ASCII
		Perform a simple ASCII case-insensitive comparison.
		This is the fastest comparison, but considers that
		accented characters are different to non-accented
		characters.

	    SC_COLLATE1
		This sorts using the "primary sorting order". This
		means that characters such as 'e' and 'é' will be
		considered the same. This method also ignores
		case.

	    SC_COLLATE2
		This will sort using both the primary and secondary
		sorting order. This is the slowest sorting method
		and should be used when presenting data to a user.

		The first pass is the same as SC_COLLATE1, meaning
		that two strings such as "role" and "rôle" would
		be sorted identically. The second pass will
		compare the diacritical marks.

    RESULT
	The relationship between the two strings.

	    < 0 means   string1 < string2
	    = 0 means   string1 == string2
	    > 0 means   string1 > string2
