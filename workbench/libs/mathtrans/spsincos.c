    FUNCTION
      Calculate the cosine and the sine of the given ffp-number
      fnum1 that represents an angle in radians. The function
      returns the sine of that number as a result and puts
      the cosine of that number into *pfnum2 which must represent
      a valid pointer to a ffp-number.

    RESULT
      *pfnum2       - Motorola fast floating point number
      direct result - Motorola fast floating point number
