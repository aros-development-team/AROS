    /* we're most likely here because main() exited. if there are remaining
     * threads, we need to do something with them. we have the following
     * options:
     * 
     * 1. leave them alone
     * 2. wait for them to finish
     * 3. kill them
     *
     * [1] is close to impossible. the main task exiting will cause all the
     * resources that DOS has open for the task, including the program code
     * itself, to be deallocated.
     *
     * [2] is fine, but there's no guarantee that they ever will finish;
     * furthermore this Close function is inside Forbid() right now, which
     * means we'd have to re-enable task switches. that's safe because this is
     * a per-opener base, but its just a little bit tricky.
     *
     * [3] ensures that the threads are gone and the main task can exit right
     * now, but AROS really doesn't provide a way to safely kill a process.
     * RemTask() will make sure it never gets scheduled again and will free
     * the memory it allocated, but it may have open libraries, filehandles,
     * etc which will get leaked. This can't be fixed without proper task
     * resource tracking.
     *
     * I've chosen [2] for now, because its really the only option that
     * doesn't cause either a system crash (executing code that no longer
     * exists) or at least instability (leaked files, libraries, etc). They
     * all suck though. The main task should arrange (or wait) for the threads
     * to exit before it exits itself.
