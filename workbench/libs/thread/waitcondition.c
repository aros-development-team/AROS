    NAME */
        AROS_LH2(BOOL, WaitCondition,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
        AROS_LHA(void *, cond,  A0),
        AROS_LHA(void *, mutex, A1),

/*  LOCATION */
        struct ThreadBase *, ThreadBase, 17, Thread)

/*  FUNCTION
        Blocks until a condition is signaled.

    INPUTS
        cond - the condition variable to wait on.
        mutex - a mutex that protects the condition

    RESULT
        TRUE if the condition was signaled, FALSE if an error occured.

    NOTES
        This function will atomically unlock the mutex and wait on the
        condition. The thread is suspended until the condition is signalled.
        After the condition is signalled, the mutex is relocked before
        returning to the caller.

        The use of a mutex in conjunction with waiting on and signalling the
        condition ensures that no signals are missed. See SignalCondition() for
        more details.

    EXAMPLE
        LockMutex(mutex);
        WaitCondition(cond, mutex);
        UnlockMutex(mutex);

    BUGS

    SEE ALSO
        CreateCondition(), DestroyCondition(), SignalCondition(),
        BroadcastCondition()

    INTERNALS
        Waiting on a condition causes the current thread to wait to receive
        SIGF_SINGLE from the signalling task.
