The description string for ParseIX

Any commodity filter object has an IX structure attached to it to be able
to sort out the input events matching a certain description to divert them
down the tree of objects attached to the filter. For convenience purposes
there is the function ParseIX() that transforms a description string into
an IX structure.

The format of the description string is as follows:

[class] {[-] (qualifier|synonym)} [[-] upstroke] [HighMap|ANSICode]

"class" specifies the input event class (see devices/inputevent.h), which
may be any of the following:

   Description word         Input event class
   --------------------     ---------------------
   "rawkey"                 IECLASS_RAWKEY
   "rawmouse"               IECLASS_RAWMOUSE
   "event"                  IECLASS_EVENT
   "pointerpos"             IECLASS_POINTERPOS
   "timer"                  IECLASS_TIMER
   "newprefs"               IECLASS_NEWPREFS
   "diskremoved"            IECLASS_DISKREMOVED
   "diskinserted"           IECLASS_DISKINSERTED

If no class is given in the description string, it's assumed to be of
IECLASS_RAWKEY.

"qualifier" may be any of those defined below; each qualifier string has a
correspondance in an input event qualifier:

   Qualifier string         Input event qualifier
   --------------------     ---------------------
   "lshift"                 IEQUALIFIER_LSHIFT
   "rshift"                 IEQUALIFIER_RSHIFT
   "capslock"               IEQUALIFIER_CAPSLOCK
   "control"                IEQUALIFIER_CONTROL
   "lalt"                   IEQUALIFIER_LALT
   "ralt"                   IEQUALIFIER_RALT
   "lcommand"               IEQUALIFIER_LCOMMAND
   "rcommand"               IEQUALIFIER_RCOMMAND
   "numericpad"             IEQUALIFIER_NUMERICPAD
   "repeat"                 IEQUALIFIER_REPEAT
   "midbutton"              IEQUALIFIER_MIDBUTTON
   "rbutton"                IEQUALIFIER_RBUTTON
   "leftbutton"             IEQUALIFIER_LEFTBUTTON
   "relativemouse"          IEQUALIFIER_RELATIVEMOUSE

If the qualifier is preceded by a '-', the filter won't care whether the
qualifier is present in the event or not.


Possible synonyms are:

    Synonym string          Synonym identifier
    -------------------     -----------------------
    "shift"                 IXSYM_SHIFT    /* either shift key */
    "caps"                  IXSYM_CAPS     /* either shift key or capslock */
    "alt"                   IXSYM_ALT      /* either alt key */

The synonyms specifies multiple qualifiers with one string. If a synonym
string is preceded by a '-', the filter won't care if the synonym is present
in the event or not.


Upstroke is the string "upstroke" and if it's not specified only downstrokes
are considered; if it's specified, the filter considers only upstrokes, and
if the '-' is present both upstrokes and downstrokes are considered.


Highmap is one of strings below:

   "space", "backspace", "tab", "enter", "return", "esc",
   "del", "help", "up", "down", "right", "left", 
   "f1", "f2", "f3","f4", "f5", "f6", "f7", "f8", "f9", "f10"

INTERNAL NOTE: There are actually a few more, see Parse.h

ANSICode is a single character that is processed via the system keymap
to obtain the code. Note that if locale.library is loaded, the result
may be different code values for the same input on different computers.

Note that all description strings are case insensitive.
