    AROS_LH2(LONG, ActivateCxObj,

/*  SYNOPSIS */

	AROS_LHA(CxObj *, co,   A0),
	AROS_LHA(LONG,    true, D0),

/*  LOCATION */

	struct Library *, CxBase, 7, Commodities)

/*  FUNCTION

    Activates/deactivates a given commodity object. (An inactive object
    doesn't perform its function on its input - it just passes it on to 
    the next object.) The activation depends on the value of 'true'; if
    it's TRUE the object is activated, if it's FALSE it's deactivated.
        All objects are created in the active state except for brokers;
    remember to activate your broker when you have linked your other
    objects to it.

    INPUTS

    co   - a pointer to a commodity object
    true - boolean telling whether the object should be activated or
           deactivated

    RESULT

    The activation state of the object prior to the operation. (0 is
    also returned if 'co' was NULL.)
