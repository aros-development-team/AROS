    FUNCTION
        Compares two ffp numbers

    RESULT
	<code>
       +1 : fnum1 > fnum2
        0 : fnum1 = fnum2
       -1 : fnum1 < fnum2


        Flags:
          zero     : fnum2 = fnum1
          negative : fnum2 < fnum1
          overflow : 0
	</code>

      ALGORITHM:
	<code>
        1st case:
          fnum1 is negative and fnum2 is positive
            or
          ( exponent(fnum1) < exponent(fnum2) and signs are equal )
          -> fnum1 < fnum2

        2nd case:
          fnum1 is positive and fnum2 is negative
            or
          ( exponent(fnum1) > exponent(fnum2) and signs are equal )
          -> fnum2 > fnum1

        now the signs and exponents must be equal

        3rd case:
          fnum1 == fnum2

        4th case:
          mantisse(fnum1) < mantisse(fnum2)
          -> fnum1 < fnum2

        final case:
          fnum1 > fnum2
