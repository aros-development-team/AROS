/* This test case is designed to illustrate a performance bug that
 * exists in cairo in which using cairo_stroke is much slower than
 * cairo_fill to draw an identical figure, (and in particular a figure
 * that is much more natural to draw with cairo_stroke). The figure is
 * a 100x100 square outline 1-pixel wide, nicely pixel aligned.
 *
 * The performance bug should affect any path whose resulting contour
 * consists only of pixel-aligned horizontal and vertical elements.
 *
 * Initial testing on on machine shows stroke as 5x slower than fill
 * for the xlib backend and 16x slower for the image backend.
