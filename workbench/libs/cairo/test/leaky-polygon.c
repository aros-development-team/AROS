/* Bug history
 *
 * 2005-01-07 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   Bug reported:
 *
 *     From: Chris <fltk@functionalfuture.com>
 *     Subject: [cairo] Render to image buffer artifacts
 *     To: cairo@cairographics.org
 *     Date: Fri, 07 Jan 2005 02:22:28 -0500
 *
 *     I've attached the code and image that shows this off.  Scaling at
 *     different levels seems to change the corruption.
 *
 *     For some reason there are artifacts in the alpha channel.  I don't know
 *     if that's the only place, but the alpha channel looks bad.
 *
 *     If you run the code and parse the attached image, directing stdout to a
 *     file, you can see in the lower left corner there are alpha values where
 *     it should be transparent.
 *     [...]
 *
 * 2005-01-11 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   I trimmed the original test case down to the code that appears here.
