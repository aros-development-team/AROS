/* Bug history
 *
 * 2004-10-27  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   There's currently a regression bug in the tessellation code. This
 *   causes each of these simple star shapes to be filled incorrectly.
 *
 *   It looks like right now we can get this test to pass by doing:
 *
 *       cvs update -r 1.16 src/cairo_traps.c
 *
 *   But we don't want to revert that change permanently since it
 *   really does correct some bugs. It must be that the old version of
 *   the code is masking some other bugs in the tessellation code. My
 *   current plan is to back this revision up for the next snapshot,
 *   but not to list the test as an expected failure since I'm
 *   planning on doing the new tessellator which should fix this
 *   problem.
 *
 * 2005-01-11 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   Keith committed some fixes that fix the original size-20
 *   star_path:
 *
 * 	* src/cairo_wideint.c: (_cairo_int32x32_64_mul),
 *	(_cairo_int64x64_128_mul):
 *	* src/cairo_wideint.h:
 *	int32x32_64_mul and int64x64_128_mul are different from their
 *	unsigned compatriots
 *
 * 2005-01-12 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   Going back to the SVG test suite, however, the original star
 *   shape is still broken. Adding both shapes now as little_star_path
 *   and big_star_path.
 *
