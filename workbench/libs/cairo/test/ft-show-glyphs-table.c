/* This test was originally inspired by this bug report:
 *
 * Error when creating pdf charts for new FreeSerifItalic.ttf
 * http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=%23474136
 *
 * The original assertion failure was fairly boring, but the later
 * glyph mispositiing was quite interesting. And it turns out that the
 * _cairo_pdf_operators_show_glyphs code is fairly convoluted with a
 * code path that wasn't being exercised at all by the test suite.
 *
 * So this is an attempt to exercise that code path. Apparently laying
 * glyphs out vertically in a table like this, (so that there's a
 * large change in Y position from one glyph to the next), exercises
 * the code well.
