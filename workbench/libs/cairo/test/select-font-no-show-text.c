/* Bug history
 *
 * 2005-04-12 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   I noticed that if we call cairo_select_font_face, but then do a
 *   cairo_destroy before ever drawing any text, then we get:
 *
 *   *** glibc detected *** double free or corruption (fasttop): 0x083274d0 ***
 *   Aborted
 *
 * 2005-04-14 Owen Taylor <otaylor@redhat.com>
 *
 *  Fixed... just a stray free().
