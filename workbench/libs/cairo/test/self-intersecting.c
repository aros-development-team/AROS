/* Bug history
 *
 * 2005-06-01  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   There's a long-standing bug in that self-intersecting paths give
 *   an incorrect result when stroked. The problem is that the
 *   trapezoids are generated incrementally along the stroke and as
 *   such, are not disjoint. The errant intersections of these
 *   trapezoids then leads to overfilled pixels.
 *
 *   The test belows first creates and fills a path. Then it creates a
 *   second path which has a stroked boundary identical to the first
 *   filled path. But the results of the two operations are
 *   different. The most obvious difference is in the central region
 *   where the entire path intersects itself. But notice that every
 *   time the path turns there are also errors on the inside of the
 *   turn, (since the subsequent trapezoids along the path intersect).
