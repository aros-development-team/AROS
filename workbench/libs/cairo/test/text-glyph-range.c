/* Related to bug 9530
 *
 * cairo_glyph_t can contain any unsigned long in its 'index', the intention
 * being that it is large enough to hold a pointer. However, this means that
 * it can specify many glyph indexes which don't exist in the font, and may
 * exceed the range of legal glyph indexes for the font backend. It may
 * also contain special values that are not usable as indexes - e.g. 0xffff is
 * kATSDeletedGlyphcode in ATSUI, a glyph that should not be drawn.
 * The font backends should handle all legal and out-of-range values
 * consistently.
 *
 * This test expects that operations on out-of-range and missing glyphs should
 * act as if they were zero-width.
