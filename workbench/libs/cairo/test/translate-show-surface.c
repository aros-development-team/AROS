/* Bug history
 *
 * 2005-04-11 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   It appears that calling cairo_show_surface after cairo_translate
 *   somehow applies the translation twice to the surface being
 *   shown. This is pretty easy to demonstrate by bringing up xsvg on
 *   an SVG file with an <image> and panning around a bit with the
 *   arrow keys.
 *
 *   This is almost certainly a regression, and I suspect there may be
 *   some interaction with the fix for move-to-show-surface.
 *
 * 2005-04-12 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   I committed a fix for this bug today.
