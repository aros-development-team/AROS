 *
 *	From: Steve Chaplin <stevech1097@yahoo.com.au>

 *	Subject: [cairo] Rotated text bug on drawable target
 *
 * 	The attached file draws text rotated 90 degrees first to a PNG file and
 *	then to a drawable. The PNG file looks fine, the text on the drawable is
 *	unreadable.

 *
 *   Looks like the major problems with this bug appeared in the great
 *   font rework between 0.1.23 and 0.2.0. And it looks like we need
 *   to fix the regression test suite to test the xlib target (since
 *   the bug does not show up in the png backend).
 *
 *   Hmm... Actually, things don't look perfect even in the PNG
 *   output. Look at how that 'o' moves around. It's particularly off
 *   in the case where it's rotated by PI.
 *
 *   And I'm still not sure about what to do for test cases with
 *   text--a new version of freetype will change everything. We may
 *   need to add a simple backend for stroked fonts and add a simple
 *   builtin font to cairo for pixel-perfect tests with text.
 *
 * 2005-08-23
 *
 *   It appears that the worst placement and glyph selection problems
 *   have now been resolved. In the past some letters were noticeably
 *   of a different size at some rotations, and there was a lot of
 *   drift away from the baseline. These problems do not appear
 *   anymore.
 *
 *   Another thing that helps is that we now have font options which
 *   we can use to disable hinting in order to get more repeatable
 *   results. I'm doing that in this test now.
 *
 *   There are still some subtle positioning problems which I'm
 *   assuming are due to the lack of finer-than-whole-pixel glyph
 *   positioning. I'm generating a reference image now by replacing
 *   cairo_show_text with cairo_text_path; cairo_fill. This will let
 *   us look more closely at the remaining positioning problems. (In
 *   particular, I want to make sure we're rounding as well as
 *   possible).
 *
 * 2007-02-21
 *
 *   Seems like all the "bugs" have been fixed and all remaining is
 *   missing support for subpixel glyph positioning.  Removing from
 *   XFAIL now.
