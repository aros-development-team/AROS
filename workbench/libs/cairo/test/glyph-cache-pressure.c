/* Bug history
 *
 * 2006-06-22  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   This is a test case to demonstrate the following bug in the xlib backend:
 *
 *	Some characters aren't displayed when using xlib (cache usage missing freeze/thaw)
 *	https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6955
 *
 *   We replicate this bug by using the cairo_scaled_font_set_max_glyphs_per_font
 *   function to artifically induce cache pressure. (This function was added
 *   for this very purpose.)
 *
 * 2006-06-22  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   Bug was simple enough to solve by just adding a freeze/thaw pair
 *   around the scaled_font's glyph cache in
 *   _cairo_xlib_surface_show_glyphs, (I went ahead and added
 *   _cairo_sacled_font_freeze/thaw_cache functions for this).
