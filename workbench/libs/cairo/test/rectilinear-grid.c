  This test checks that boxes not aligned to pixels are drawn
  correctly.

  In particular the corners of the boxes are drawn incorrectly by
  cairo-image in cairo 1.10.0, because overlapping boxes are passed to
  a span converter which assumes disjoint boxes as input.

  This results in corners to be drawn with the wrong shade.
