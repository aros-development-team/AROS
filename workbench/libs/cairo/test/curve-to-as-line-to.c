/* At one point, an optimization was proposed for cairo in which a
 * curve_to would be optimized as a line_to. The initial (buggy)
 * implementation verified that the slopes of several segments of the
 * spline's control polygon were identical, but left open the
 * possibility of an anti-parallel slope for one segment.
 *
 * For example, given a spline with collinear control points (A,B,C,D)
 * positioned as follows:
 *
 *	C--A--B--D
 *
 * The code verified identical slopes for AB, CD, and AD. The missing
 * check for the BC segment allowed it to be anti-parallel to the
 * others as above, and hence invalid to replace this spline with the
 * AD line segment.
