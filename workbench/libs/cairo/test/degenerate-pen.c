/* We're demonstrating here a bug originally reported by Benjamin Otte
 * on the cairo mailing list here, (after he ran into this problem
 * with various flash animations):
 *
 *	[cairo] Assertion `i < pen->num_vertices' failed in 1.4.10
 *	http://lists.cairographics.org/archives/cairo/2007-August/011282.html
 *
 * The problem shows up with an extreme transformation matrix that
 * collapses the pen to a single line, (which means that
 * _cairo_slope_compare cannot handle adjacent vertices in the pen
 * since they have parallel slope).
 *
 * This test case tests degenerate pens in several directions and uses
 * round caps to force the stroking code to attempt to walk around the
 * pen doing slope comparisons.
