/* This test case is designed to exercise the following bug:
 *
 *	Skew transforms were broken by the cairo update in December
 *	https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=373632
 *
 * What's happening is that the rectangle is being skewed into the
 * following shape:
 *
 * a__b
 *  \ \
 *   \ \
 *    \ \
 *     \ \
 *      \ \
 *      d\_\c
 *
 * and the bug is that _cairo_traps_tessellate_convex_quad is
 * comparing b.x as less then d.x and therfore determining that the bc
 * edge is left of the ad edge. The fix is simply to compare c.x to
 * d.x instead of b.x to d.x .
