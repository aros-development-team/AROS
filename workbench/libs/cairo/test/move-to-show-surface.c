/* Bug history
 *
 * 2004-10-25  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   It looks like cairo_show_surface has no effect if it follows a
 *   call to cairo_move_to to any coordinate other than 0,0. A little
 *   bit of poking around suggests this isn't a regression, (at least
 *   not since the last pixman snapshot).
 *
 * 2005-04-02  Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   Status: RESOLVED
 *
 *   Inside cairo_show_surface the current point was being used as
 *   both source and destination offsets. After fixing that to use 0,0
 *   as the source offset and the current point as the destination
 *   offset, the bug seems to be gone.
 *
