There are a few known bugs in 1.10 that have been fixed in master, but
appear to be non-trivial to backport without fear of causing other
regressions. The impact of these bugs is considered to be less than of a
risk than rewriting the code.

Zero Path Extents
-----------------
A closed degenerate path is reported as having extents (0, 0) x (0, 0),
whereas the expected value is (x, y) x (0, 0). This regression has existed
since at least 1.2.
