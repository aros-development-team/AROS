	AROS_LH1(LONG, PopChunk,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(struct IFFHandle *, iff, A0),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct Library *, IFFParseBase, 15, IFFParse)

/*  FUNCTION
	Pops a context node of the context stack. Usually called
	in write mode to signal the end of a chunk.


    INPUTS
	iff    - pointer to IFFHandle struct.

    RESULT
	error  -  0 if successfull, IFFERR_#? otherwise.

    BUGS

    SEE ALSO
	PushChunk()

    INTERNALS

    Frees a contextnode an all its related LCIs and removes it from the stack-list
    If we are in write mode, we will update the cn_Size in the chunk according
    t cn_Scan, and we will also insert an align byte if necessary


    If the stream was of PushChunked() as IFFSIZE_UNKNOWN, we have to seek backwards
    and write the correct size.
    Since non RSEEK streams are automagically buffered by
    WriteStream, we don't have to fiddle with it here.
    However if the stream is buffered, we MUST see if we are
    about to pop the chunk that started the Buffering (in PushChunk)
