#### 6.13 RELEASE ########################################################

2011-11-26 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 6.13 release preparations.

2011-01-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * all/Makefile: fixed the dependency generation to respect the system specific
    object file path.

2010-12-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * codesets.c: added some "const" keywords to avoid type casts.

2010-10-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * dist/Install: adapted the Installer script to respect MorphOS' default
    location for 3rd party libraries.

2010-10-05 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * libinit.c: make sure that removing the library during LibClose() really
    operates on the correct base. Calling LibExpunge() on MorphOS is wrong,
    since that takes no parameter but expects the base to be in A6. We work
    around this by using an additional function which gets called from
    LibClose() and LibExpunge() with the correct base pointer.

2010-09-28 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * tools/mkrelease.sh: remove the mmakefile.src file from the distribution.

#### 6.12 RELEASE ########################################################

2010-09-23 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 6.12 release preparations.

2010-09-20 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * codesets.c: fixed a possible length issue in case a UTF8 sequence had to be
    replaced more than once by "lookalike" characters. Before the length of the
    sequence to be replaced was not modified after the first replacement. Thanks
    to Bernd Gollesch for the hint.

2010-09-10 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * codesets.c: CodesetsUTF8ToStr() did not return the correct length of the
    converted string in case mapping of foreign characters was requested and
    the string really contained mappable characters which might be replaced
    by longer ASCII strings of than one single character.

2010-09-03 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * libinit.c, debug.c: clear all semaphore structures before calling
    InitSemaphore().

#### 6.11 RELEASE ########################################################

2010-09-01 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 6.11 release preparations.

2010-08-16 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * libinit.c: the library init code now ensures that the entry code is really
    the first code to be executed in case the .library is executed like a
    regular command by accident.
  * include/SDI_compiler.h: updated to latest version.

2010-08-12 Pavel Fedin <pavel_fedin@mail.ru>

  * src/codesets.c: fixed pointer to integer conversion for 64-bit systems
  * developer/examples/demo1.c: likewise
  * include/SDI_hook.h: added missing include for AROS

2010-07-01 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * src/init.c: enabled querying of ENV:CODEPAGES to obtain the default codeset
    for all systems.
  * src/init.c: added car plate codes and ISO3166 Alpha 3 country code detection
    when obtaining the system default codeset. Thus a user can use a system
    default language/codeset which doesn't match the country's language/codeset.
    This fulfils feature request #2971890.

2010-06-15 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * src/codesets.c: added a union of several pointer types to avoid the tons of
    warnings of GCC4+ about type punned pointer accesses.

2010-06-11 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Install: extended the final message that a reboot might be necessary to be
    able to use the just installed version.

2010-06-10 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * src/libinit.c: fixed a warning for the OS3 build.
  * misc: added all necessary stuff for an automated build for all supported
    platforms. This also includes an Installer script for an easy installation.

2010-06-07 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/SDI_compiler.h: updated to latest version.

2010-06-03 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * developer/examples/DetectCodeset.c: fixed some warnings about wrong types
    in the printf() calls.
  * developer/examples/b64[ed].c: fixed some warnings about wrong types in the
    printf() calls.

2010-06-03  Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * fixes for 64-bit AROS. Changed some ULONG to IPTR to get rid of warnings
    like "conversion from/to integer to/from pointer with different size".

2010-04-23 Pavel Fedin <pavel_fedin@mail.ru>

  * src/libinit.c: use NewStackSwap() under AROS, re-enabled stack swapping under MorphOS
  * src/debug.c: use VNewRawDoFmt() for debugging output under AROS, the same as in MorphOS

2010-04-23 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * src/libinit.c: replaced some #ifdef's by macros.

2010-01-22 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * charsets/windows-1253.txt: added greek Windows-1253 codepage as this one is
    documented to be incompatible to ISO8859-7 (see http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Windows-1253).

#### 6.10 RELEASE ########################################################

2009-12-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 6.10 release preparations.

2009-12-10 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * init.c: removed some unnecessary type casts.
  * codesets.c: adding the fake UTF8, UTF16 and UTF32 codesets now makes sure
    that the code tables of these codesets only contain zero values. Otherwise
    CodesetsFindBestCodeset() might choose one of these by accident, even if
    they are just fake entries.
  * codesets.c: excluded the UTF16 and UTF32 codesets from the "find best" check
    completely, like the UTF8 codeset was excluded before already.

2009-12-09 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * codesets.c: added some debug output when adding the individual internal and
    external codesets.
  * codesets.c: broke down the text check against a single codeset into smaller
    functions to make things easier to understand and maintain.
  * codesets.c: asking MorphOS for system codesets could fail if there is either
    no default keymap or the keymap has no codepage. This let the complete
    initial codeset scanning fail. Now only failed memory allocations will be
    treated as errors. This conforms with treatment of all other codesets. I
    guess this caused much of the recent trouble with MorphOS and codesets.lib
    V6.9.

2009-12-08 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: cleaned up several parts of the source code for better readability and
    maintainability. The pool semaphore was often used to protect some code
    parts against concurrent execution where it was not needed at all. The pool
    semaphore is for meant to protect the memory pool and nothing else!
    Added the GetHead/Tail/Succ/Pred functions to navigate within the codeset
    lists to make things more safe.

2009-11-02 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * debug.c, libinit.c: reworked the debug system to use the same stuff as YAM
    does. Furthermore we now have a semaphore to prevent several concurring
    applications from screwing up the log by writing out debug messages at the
    same time.

2009-10-29 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * codesets.c: removed a superflous LF from a debug message.

#### 6.9 RELEASE #########################################################

2009-10-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 6.9 release preparations.

2009-09-19 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: added a name to all memory pools for OS4.

2009-08-14 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Makefiles: added "-g" to the debug flags. It seems the OS3 GCC 2.95.3 cross
    compiler needs this to generate debug infos at all.

2009-07-21 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * libinit.c: in case something in the LibInit() call fails everything set up
    before will now correctly be freed again to avoid memory leaks.

2009-07-10 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * codesets.c: a conversion with identical source and destination codesets no
    longer fails, although such a conversion doesn't make much sense. Instead
    a copy of the source string is created which must be freed by a call to
    CodesetsFree() as usual.

2009-07-02  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * libraries/codesets.h: Added standard UTF#?_TYPEDEF around UTF8, UTF16 and
    UTF32 typedefs to make sure they dont clash with system types in the future.

2009-06-15  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * codesets.c: workaround for locale.library bug in MorphOS 2.2.
    Fixes bug #2496990.

2009-06-08  Staf Verhaegen <staf.verhaegen@skynet.be>

  * libinit.c: On AROS library base is not necessarily passed on the stack
    to the lib (de)init functions. Use AROS macros for the definition of those
    functions so that the passing is always done in the right way.

2009-06-07  Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * Makefiles for examples and linkerlib fixed.
  * Bugfix in demo1.c. (variable codesets defined outside application
    to ensure that it exists when it's used)

2009-06-02  Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * Some warnings removed
  * Use standard MUIM_Application_AboutMUI because custom method
    crashes under AROS

2009-06-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * lib_protos.h: fixed the compilation for OS3, MOS and AROS because of
    incompatible function prototypes for the library functions with a variable
    argument list.

2009-05-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/SDI_lib.h: updated to the latest version.

2009-05-02 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * libinit.c: RTF_EXTENDED was not set for the MorphOS build making revision
    number ineffective.

2009-04-30 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/SDI_lib.h: updated to the latest version.

2009-04-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/defines/codesets.h: regenerated the AROS codesets.h includes by
    using the very latest sfdc 1.4 tool. That should hopefully fix all existing
    issues with using codesets.lib for an AROS project.

2009-04-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/defines/codesets.h: fixed the codesets AROS defines.h include by
    shifting the function offsets by one to match the offsets using in the 68k
    build.

2009-04-01  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * libinit.c: fixed broken stackswap_call() prototype for the assembler
    version.

2009-04-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/defines/codesets.h: updated the AROS codesets.h file to the one
    that is distributed with AROS.

2009-03-30  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * codesets.c: the UTF8 compare function now uses a proper prototype to be used
    with qsort().
  * codesets.c: in case the default codeset could not be created two libraries
    were left open in the MOS build.

2009-03-27  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * libinit.c: reenabled the prototype for the stackswap_call() function to
    avoid warnings about implicitly declared functions.
  * codesets.c: fixed some warnings about uninitialized variables.

2009-03-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include: updated SDI headers to very latest versions.

2009-03-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * libinit.c: introduced a small fix to get the file compiled with the fixed
    SDI headers again.
  * include: fixed the SDI headers.
  * Makefile: adapted makefile to directly specify the target CPU for the AROS
    build. If you now want to compile AROS you have to explicitly set
    "OS=aros-i386" or "OS=aros-ppc", for example.
  * version.h: added x86_64 CPU type to allow compilation of codesets.library
    for x86_64 AROS target.
  * libinit.c: added RTF_EXTENDED and library revision number for the AROS
    build.

2009-03-24  Pavel Fedin <sonic.amiga@gmail.com>

  * codesets.c, convertUTF.c, util.c, lib_protos.h : implemented complete UTF32
    support
  * libcodesets: added portable autoinit code
  * developer/examples/autoopen.c: added autoopen test

2009-03-23  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * developer/examples/Convert.c: added the usual information header.
  * developer/examples/Convert.c: made the demo program compilable for OS4.
  * codesets.c: fixed various warnings about wrong types. Also removed all TAB
    characters I have spotted. Please note that we are using space characters
    only for indentation.

2009-03-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: minor adaptions
  * include: updated the SDI headers to their latest versions and incorporated
    the latest changes from Pavel.

2009-03-20  Pavel Fedin <sonic.amiga@gmail.com>

  * misc: many fixes in various places, code merge, got rid of many #ifdef's. AROS
    version can be built or cross-built outside of AROS build system. Fixed "demo1"
    program to work under MorphOS

2009-01-28  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * developer/examples/demo1.c: replaced use of the custom class Textinput.mcc
    by a simple Text object, as this class is not installed on all systems and
    may also have caused bug #2539755. However, the custom TextEditor.mcc class
    is still required, but this one is correctly checked if it should be
    missing.

2009-01-27  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * developer/examples/demo1.c: added some NULL checks to avoid stricmp() to be
    called with NULL pointers. This should fix bug #2539755.

2009-01-10  Staf Verhaegen <staf.verhaegen@skynet.be>

  * codesets.conf (AROS): Update version, date and copyright info

#### 6.8 RELEASE #########################################################

2009-01-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 6.8 release preparations.

2009-01-02  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * codesets.c: MorphOS code was using LocaleBase before it was initialised
    and using library under MorphOS 2.0 or newer would always crash. Locale
    library is now opened locally to make sure we have correct version (V51).
    This fixes bug #2459558.
  * base64.c: avoid using now obsolete AllocDosObject() in MorphOS.

#### 6.7 RELEASE #########################################################

2008-12-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 6.7 release preparations.

2008-12-19  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * codesets.c, codepages.c: separated the constant code pages from the actual
    code to create smaller source files.

2008-12-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: minor cosmetic changes to make the new MorphOS functionality
    fit better into our current environment.

2008-12-18  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * codesets.c: query and add currently active code page to codesets if
    running on MorphOS 2.

2008-12-16  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * init.c: replaced the obsolete CreatePool() and DeletePool() calls with
    AllocSysObject() and FreeSysObject() call for the OS4 build. Also restored
    the old MEMF_ANY memory flags for the other platforms. For OS4 MEMF_SHARED
    will be used as before.

2008-12-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: replaced the obsolete ExAll() usage with a proper ExamineDir()
    usage for the OS4 build.
  * base64.c: replaced the obsolete ExamineFH() use with ExamineObject() for
    the OS4 build.
  * codesets.c: added an internal list of well-known codeset aliases. This
    alias list is used whenever CodesetsFind() is used. It allows applications
    to supply an alias name of a codeset and see it directly matched to the
    correct MIME name.

2008-12-14  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

 * codesets.c: when replacing UTF8 chars by ASCII look-alike replacements the
   destination buffer size was never increased but the index for the new
   characters was correctly increased. This caused random memory accesses after
   a few replacements which usually went unnoticed when only very replacements
   happened. On OS3 this went completely unnoticed.

2008-12-12  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

 * codesets.c: massive code cleanup. Replaced all TAB characters by spaces and
   changed lots of implicit result checks to explicit ones.
 * utils.c: added the usual ENTER/RETURN/LEAVE macro calls.
 * utils.c: the custom implementations of AllocVecPooled() and FreeVecPooled()
   can now be enabled and disabled by single #define's. By default OS4 and
   MorphOS will use their own kernel supplied versions.

2008-12-08  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

 * utils.c: added a size check to reallocVecPooled() just in case the new
   allocation is smaller than the old one.
 * codesets.c: added missing RETURN() macro call.
 * codesets.c: added more missing macro calls and cleaned up some code passages.
 * init.c: replaced MEMF_ANY by MEMF_SHARED for OS4.

2008-08-16  Staf Verhaegen <staf.verhaegen@skynet.be>

 * codesets.conf (AROS): Update version and copyright
 * mmakefile.src (AROS): Don't let codesets.library depend on libcodesets.a

2008-07-29  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * developer/docs/codesets.doc: fixed the documentation on the Hook uses
    as an incorrect hook prototype was used throughout the examples.

#### 6.6 RELEASE #########################################################

2008-07-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final release preparations

2008-07-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * developer/examples: replaced the multiple makefiles by a single
    multiplatform makefile.

2008-07-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: renamed the new mapping functionality to the more untuitive
    "CSA_MapForeignToASCII" term.

2008-07-03  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * codesets.c: fixed some copy'n'paste bugs in the lookup table.
  * codesets.c: in case one of the replacement functions returned an UTF8
    sequence the wrong string was used in the next loop, causing an endless
    loop.

2008-07-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: added official ISO replacements for the currency symbols in
    case the CSA_MapUnknownToASCII attribute is used.
  * codesets.c: fixed a bug in the newly reworked replacement function which
    didn't work as expected and always replace unknown chars with '?' instead
    of replacing it with the looklike char sequence.

2008-07-02  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * codesets.c: calling the replacement hook will be skipped now if the
    internal table yielded a suitable replacement.
  * codesets.c: removed that silly restriction of 10 replacement tries again.
    It is up to the developer to make sure that no endless loop happens and
    that the replacement hook handles all data correctly and as documented.
  * codesets.c, codesets.doc: the internal and the external replacement via
    hooks are now handled completely independently, however, the hook will be
    called after the internal replacement and thus can override the internal
    replacement. Furthermore if either function returns an UTF8 sequence this
    sequence will be passed again to these functions as long as no suitable
    code is found in the active codeset. 10 retries will be done at most to
    avoid endless loops.
  * codesets.c, codesets.doc: renamed the attribute CSA_MapUnknownToAscii to
    CSA_MapUnknownToASCII. Also implemented CSA_MapUnknownHook, which will call
    the specified hook function in case no internal replacement for an unknown
    UTF8 sequence could be found. This way an application can provide its own
    additional "to ASCII" remapping.

2008-07-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c, codesets.doc: added the new CSA_MapUnknownToAscii attribute to
    our autodocs and added its use in the CodesetsConvertStrA() function
    as well.

2008-07-01  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * codesets.c: added the Latin Extended-A section to the lookup table.
  * codesets.c: implemented the binary search in the new replacement lookup
    table.

2008-07-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: renamed replacement function to mapUTF8toAscii() which more
    describes what this function does. In addition the new attribute is now
    named CSA_MapUnknownToAscii. In addition the new function contains a first
    experimental utf8map lookup table which we can use in future instead of
    the long switch/case statements.

2008-06-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: fixed the PRIME character replacement.

2008-06-29  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: added more replacement UTF8 replaceent characters to the internal
    list.

2008-06-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: slightly updated our char replacement list - still more to come.

2008-06-27  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * codesets.c: changed the source pointer type of getReplacementUTF8Char() from
    "char *" to "unsigned char *". For OS4 this should make no difference, since
    the char type defaults to unsigned with GCC 4. For OS3 this makes a huge
    difference, because for GCC 2 char is still signed and some comparisons will
    be "const false" or even outside the valid value range in switch() statements
    in this case.
  * libinit.c, codesets.c: removed some warnings about uninitialized variables
    and "void *" pointer arithmetic.

2008-06-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c, misc: started implemented feature request #1879875 by
    introducing a new CSA_ReplaceUnknown attribute for CodesetsConvertStr()
    and CodesetsUTF8ToStr(). When this attribute is set to TRUE, some
    well-known UTF8 sequences which can't be directly mapped to a certain
    destination codeset will be automatically replaced by common 7bit
    character representations. This should make some UTF8 encoded
    text passages a bit more readable in case they contain punctation
    and similar generic characters which can't be directly mapped. Please
    note, however, that this is still work in progress and that the
    replacement list should be enhanced by having a look what chars can be
    mapped.
  * misc: updated the build environment to take a Makefile.dep dependency
    file into account.

2008-06-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: fixed broken build and renamed the gluecode lib directory name.

2008-06-24  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * libcodesets.a: added MorphOS glue lib to developers dir.
  * init.c: we must use localised Strnicmp() string comparison routine to
    support supplement characters properly.
  * init.c: added localised chech written in local charset (MorphOS uses
    localised language names).

2008-04-15  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * developer/examples/vastubs.c, developer/examples/makefile.os3: added
    vararg stubs for OS3 to be able to link against clib2.

2007-12-26  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * src/init.c: the system default charset is now identified by using
    GetKeymapCodepage() function on MorphOS 2.0.

#### 6.5 RELEASE #########################################################

2007-12-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: preparations for upcoming v6.5 release.
  * docs: added the missing documentation about the CodesetsFreeVecPooled()
    function and corrected the examples accordingly. This should fix
    fix bug #1823214.

2007-11-25  Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * misc: ported sources to AROS. The final build is currently only
    available with the AROS project itself and this is still work in
    progress.

2007-09-05  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * codesets.c: fixed a signedness warning.
  * codesets.c: changed all CSA_SourceLen occurences to default to the string
    length of the given CSA_Source. Additionally CSA_Source is checked to be a
    valid pointer. A NULL pointer will result in a length of zero.
  * codesets.doc: updated the docs to reflect the meaning of CSA_SourceLen.

2007-08-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * libinit.c: adapted library initialization interface to match the
    changes done in e.g. TextEditor.mcc and which should mainly fix stack
    related issues on MorphOS systems.

#### 6.4 RELEASE #########################################################

2007-07-17  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * libinit.c: we use inline assembler for defining a new generic
    stackswap_call() function that will be used to surround the initBase()
    call by StackSwap() uses. This inline assembler should guarantee that
    the function will not be inlined by the compiler and work properly on
    all different supported platforms.

2007-07-04  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * libinit.c: the StackSwapStruct is now placed on the stack instead of
    allocating it in one block with the new stack itself, as that caused instant
    crashes.

2007-07-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: CSA_ErrPtr can now be specified in the CodesetsUTF8ToStrA()
    function to get informed about the amount of not convertable characters
    found during the conversion. This fullfils feature request #1724860.
  * libinit.c: initBase() will now be called in LibInit() again as this is
    the smoother variant. But a StackSwap() construct protects us from stack
    overruns on OS3/MOS machines.

2007-07-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * libinit.c: reworked library manager interface to use inline asm-based obtain
    and release functions according to the latest output of idltool 52.7
  * codesets.doc: applied patch for CodesetsUTF8ToStrA() function kindly provided
    by Steffen Gutmann.

2007-06-13  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * debug.c: unified the _DPRINTF() functions for all platforms.

2007-06-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * #?/Makefile: minor update/optimization on Makefiles.
  * libinit.c: partly reintroduced the initialization of codesets.library in
    LibOpen() via a seperate init locking variable due to occuring stack issues
    on OS3.
  * debug.c: removed <proto/intuition.h> as it isn't required at all.

2007-06-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * libinit.c, misc: reworked library init code to call the initBase/freeBase()
    function in the respective LibInit/LibExpunge() function instead and just deal
    with the open counter and the late expunge flag in the LibOpen/LibClose()
    functions. This should make the library initialization more clear and
    hopefully also less error prone.

2007-06-05  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * debug.c: fixed the variable parsing and the final output of the debug flags.
  * developer/examples/makefile.os4: removed the -pipe option from the command
    line as the OS4 native GCC does not support this yet.

2007-05-24  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * libinit.c: the open counter is now bump as first action in LibOpen(), right
    before calling baseInit(). baseInit() may scan some directories which may
    take an unpredictable amount of time. While this happens the system may
    invoke LibExpunge() which will immediately remove the library again from the
    system, becasue the open counter is still zero. This should fix the random
    crashes that some people were experiencing. Maybe a semaphore protected
    LibExpunge() could do the same...

#### 6.3 RELEASE #########################################################

2007-01-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * Makefile: replaced the single target makefiles with a general Makefile
    that contains HOST and TARGET os identification code via 'uname'.
    This way we can easily compile codesets.library with a single makefile
    for all our platforms.
  * misc: bumped the year to 2007

2007-01-11  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * base64.c: fixed bug #1608004 where b64 encoder never null terminated
    the output string (when encoding to a string buffer).

2006-12-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: added alternative names to all ISO based codeset names as
    some applications might want to query for these abbreviations instead.
  * misc: fixed all still pending compiler warnings

2006-09-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * makefile.#?: added -Wwrite-string warning option to let the compiler
    more easily find const/non-const issues.
  * include/SDI_#?: update the sdi headers to latest versions.
  * include/interfaces: fixed minor bug #1560515 where the interface
    definition was slightly wrong.

2006-09-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * developer/include/inline: added a VBCC inline version of our current
    codesets API.

#### 6.2 RELEASE #########################################################

2006-05-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: reworked the whole API of the CodesetsFindBestA() function which
    was more or less unused until today. The function now only accepts a
    variable tagitem list. All former fixed arguments have to be set via
    TagItems now. This should make the function more flexible for the
    future. In addition, I added the cyrillic codeset autodetection code
    kindly provided by Alexey Ivanov. codesets.library can now be used
    together with the new CSA_CodesetsFamily attribute to specify the
    family to which against the supplied text should be matched. This will
    also allow to add more different codeset families in future to the
    autodetection. Revised the autodocs and includes of CodesetsFindBest()
    accordingly.

2006-04-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * Makefile.os4, libinit.c: reworked the OS4 library interface to
    cleanly compile with newlib instead of clib2. Future OS4 version will
    be built for newlib only as that is the standard runtime library for
    AmigaOS4.

2006-04-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * libinit.c: slightly reworked the library init/expunge code to act a
    bit more robust and don't use any semaphore during the library expunge
    phase which in fact should cure the crashing on MorphOS during
    expunging of the library.

#### 6.1 RELEASE #########################################################

2006-03-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: replaced the underscore char '_' use for an unknown char
    during an UTF-8 conversion by a questionmark '?' as this might be
    a more proper replacement and it doesn't trigger YAM's text
    highlighting routines.
  * codesets.c: slightly reworked the ReadTable() function. Reworked
    the CodesetsUTF8ToStrA() function to correctly take respect of the
    CSA_SourceLen attribute as documented. Previously it always
    converted until strlen(src). Now in case the SourceLen is specified
    it will stop converting the UTF8 string.
  * libinit.c, base.h: moved the internal charset table initialization
    routine from the LibInit() function to the first call of the
    LibOpen(). This in fact should fix the various strange crash bugs
    reported since the release of 6.0.
  * init.c: changed the library base definitions to use "extern" and
    also define "__UtilityBase" to please constraints of clib2.

2006-03-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: switched from CVS to the new SVN (subversion) services of
    sf.net. Should should definitly increase our project's flexibility.

2006-02-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * utils.c: removed the unnecessary snprintf()/sprintf() stuff as it
    is not required anymore.
  * codesets.c: fixed some minor compiler warnings and added some more
    debug output.
  * include/SDI_lib.h: updated to latest SDI_lib.h, which fixes some
    compiler issues with GCC3+ under OS3.

#### 6.0 RELEASE #########################################################

2006-02-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 6.0 release preparations.
  * codesets.doc: updated the autodocs according to our latest changes
    sind the open-source release of the library. Added some common
    examples and also restructed it.
  * codesets.c: changed all "struct MinList *" related functions to use
    the newly defined "struct codesetList *" instead. This new type
    instead of the public MinList type keeps those functions more
    flexible in future.
  * codesets.c: changed CodesetsListDelete() to be a tagitem receiving
    function. This should make it much more usable in future.
  * codesets.c: modified all CodesetsListX() functions to return a
    boolean value to signal if an operating succeeded or not.
  * libraries/codesets.h: changed all tag items to carry the shortcut
    CSA instead of the long CODESETSA_XXXX string. This should make the
    use of codesets.library more intuitive.

2006-02-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: changed the scandir function to use ExAll() instead
    of using the FileInfoBlock structures. This should be slightly
    faster and more consistent.
  * codesets.c: replaced the previously added internal private
    codeset list management functions with a more transparent
    approach using separate functions (CodesetsListCreateA(),
    CodesetsListDelete(), etc.). Now a user may generate an
    unlimited number of own private codesets lists allowing him
    to load additional codesets on runtime from either a directory,
    file or already existing codesets.

2006-02-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: added a new internal "findPrivateCodesetList()"
    function and made CodesetsFindA()/CodesetsFindBestA() aware of
    the newly added CODESETSA_RefTask attribute which will allow a
    user to directly specify the referencing task for searching for
    a private codesets list. This in fact may only be used in
    multithreaded applications where functions like CodesetsFindA()
    are used from a different task/thread than the OpenLibrary()
    of codesets.library was done.

2006-02-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: implemented a private codeset management facility. Now
    codeset.library will automatically scan an eventually existing
    PROGDIR:Charsets and if present will load those codesets in a
    per-task private list of codesets which will be added to the
    global list of supported codesets as well.
  * misc: implemented new CodesetsConvertStrA() library function which
    will allow to specify a source and destination codeset as well as
    a source string. The source string is then automatically converted
    to the supplied destination string. This in turn should give a
    plenty transparent method to convert strings from one codeset
    to another.
  * added the UTF-8 codeset to the internal list of supported codesets.
    However, as the UTF-8 codeset is a very central codeset it is
    treated special in such case that if UTF8Create() is used with a
    string that is already encoded in UTF8, false will be returned.

2005-12-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * init.c: changed the system default charset identification routines
    to use the GetDiskFontCtrl() function on AmigaOS4 to find out
    the currently active system charset. In addition, if this
    identification fails it will try to find out the charset by falling
    back to checking ENV:CHARSET, then using ENV:LANGUAGE to parse ther
    internal language<>codeset list and if this also fails it will
    directly use locale.library to find out the language to check
    our own internal fallback tables for default charset<>language
    mapping.
  * codesets.c: if running on AmigaOS4, codesets.library will now
    automatically query diskfont.library for the existing codesets
    and also load all existing mapping tables accordingly. It will
    also check if all internally known codesets are already present
    and if one of it was not loaded through diskfont.library, the
    internal mapping tables will be used as well.
  * debug.c,h: added a whole debugging output system adapted and
    relicensed from the YAM project. Now an environment variable
    can be usd (ENV:codesets.library.debug) to place debugging
    tags and allow to differniate which output should be displayed
    during runtime and which one not. This should hopefully make
    the debugging of the library much more easier.

2005-12-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c, codesets_table.h: updated internal codesets
    implementations in accordance to the latest implementation in
    SimpleMail. Now codesets.library also supports the Amiga-1251
    and ISO-8859-16.
  * misc: did some general housekeeping code cleanups.

2005-12-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * developer/examples: ported the demo1.c application to all our
    supported platforms
  * include/SDI_*.h: update SDI headers to latest versions.

2005-12-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * bumped version to v6 as the GCC/OS4 porting may introduce some
    oddities which we might eliminate during the v6 release cycle.
    Please note that this first OS3/GCC and OS4 porting effort may
    still contain some oddities here and there as large portions are
    still untested. However, we may have some time to fix step by step
    until we can prepare a v6.0 release.
  * got rid of all common compiler warnings which should make bug
    hunting much more easier.
  * restructed sources to use othe latest SDI-headers for easily
    maintaining the sources for all three platforms without
    introducing heaps to #ifdef's.
  * dropped all "register" attribute usages as modern compilers like
    GCC normally know where to put variables on registers and where not
    so these attributes are anyway not necessary.
  * dropped smakefile and all 68k ASM parts as we are moving towards
    building with GCC for all targets.
  * restructed the build environment of codesets.library to use
    GCC for all three major platforms (OS3/OS4/MOS). Also dropped
    the SAS/C build process. Sorry, but SAS/C is really way too old
    and too buggy to still be considered a sensible compiler and
    maintaining codesets.library for the very same compiler should
    eliminate some problems in future, too.
  * partly applied OS4 porting patch supplied by Alexandre Balaban.

2005-11-23  Alfonso Ranieri <alforan@tin.it>

  * initial checkin of LGPLed sources
