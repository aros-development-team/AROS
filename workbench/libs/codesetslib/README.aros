README.aros
===========

The codesets.library is hosted on Sourceforge:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/codesetslib/

Avoid by all means that the AROS port is modified independently from
the original Sourceforge project.

TODO
----
* Tests (endianness etc.)
* Adopt SDI macros to AROS and remove AROS compatibility macros
* Use stackswap code from libint.c for AROS
* Merge libinit-aros.c into libinit.c
