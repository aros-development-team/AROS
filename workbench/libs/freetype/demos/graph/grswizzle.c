/* technical note:
 *
 *   the following code is used to simulate the color display of an
 *   OLPC screen on a traditional LCD or CRT screen. First, here's more or
 *   less how the laptop's hardware works:
 *
 *   when in color mode, the screen uses the following colored pixels
 *   arrangement, where each pixel is square and can have its luminosity
 *   set between 0 and 255:
 *
 *     R G B R G B ....
 *     G B R G B R
 *     B R G B R G
 *     R G B R G B
 *     G B R G B R
 *     B R G B R G
 *     :
 *     :
 *
 *   in its normal mode of operation, the laptop's graphics chip gets its
 *   data from a normal frame buffer (where each pixel has three
 *   components: R, G and B) but only selects the red signal for the first
 *   pixel, the green signal for the second pixel, etc...
 *
 *   in other words, it ignores 2/3rd of the frame buffer data !
 *
 *   there is also another interesting mode of operation, so-called
 *   "anti-aliasing mode" where the value of displayed pixel is obtained
 *   by performing a simple 3x3 linear filter on the frame-buffer data.
 *   the filter's matrix being:
 *
 *       0   1/8   0
 *
 *      1/8  1/2  1/8
 *
 *       0   1/8   0
 *
 *   note that this filtering is per-color, so the *displayed* intensity of
 *   a given red pixel corresponds to an average of the pixel's red value and
 *   its four neighboring pixels' red values.
 *
 *   note that the code below uses a 3-lines work buffer, where each line
 *   in the buffer holds a copy of the source frame buffer.
 *
 *   more exactly, each line has 'width+2' pixels, where the first and last
 *   pixels are always set to 0. this allows us to ignore edge cases in the
 *   filtering code.
 *
 *   similarly, we artificially extend the source buffer with zero-ed lines
 *   above and below.

 *
 * a traditional display will not, and this will result in an image that
 * will be much darker (due to all the zeroes).
