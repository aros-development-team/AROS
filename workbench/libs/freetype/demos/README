This package contains example programs for the FreeType 2 library.


WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING

  The Makefile and Jamfile contained in this directory assume that the
  FreeType 2  library sources are  located in `../freetype2'.   If you
  downloaded one  of the  stable FreeType 2  source packages  from our
  server, you most probably have to rename its directory, for example:

    mv freetype-2.3.7 freetype2       on Unix
    rename freetype-2.3.7 freetype2   on Windows

WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING


  First compile the FreeType 2 library, then say `make'.  However, you
  must rename  the directory of the FreeType 2  library to `freetype2'
  (or create a symlink) before doing this.

  Note  that  the  demonstration  programs  include  a  tiny  graphics
  sub-system that includes `drivers' to display Windows on Win32, X11,
  BeOS, Mac,  and OS/2.  The build system  should automatically detect
  which driver to use based on the current platform.

  ==========

    X11 issues
    ----------

    When building the demos, the build system tries to detect your X11
    path  by  looking for  the  patterns  `X11/bin', `X11R6/bin',  and
    `X11R5/bin' in your current path  (in this order).  If no X11 path
    is found, some demo programs  will not be able to display graphics
    and  will fail.   If you  have X11  in an  unusual place,  use the
    X11_PATH make  variable.  More  than one directory,  if necessary,
    must be separated with spaces.  Example:

        make X11_PATH="/usr/openwin /usr/local/X11R6"

    If  you don't  have X11  at all,  fix the  definition of  the EXES
    variable as described in the top-level Makefile.

    Using a different build directory
    ---------------------------------

    If the `configure' script of the FreeType 2 library is  run from a
    separate build directory,  it creates a dummy  Makefile which sets
    some  variables before  including  the top-level  Makefile of  the
    source  directory.  This dummy  Makefile can also be  used for the
    ft2demos package to be compiled in a different build directory:

       make FT2DEMOS=1 -f /path/to/freetype2/build-dir/Makefile

    If necessary, adapt  the `TOP_DIR_2' variable to make it  point to
    the ft2demos source directory.
