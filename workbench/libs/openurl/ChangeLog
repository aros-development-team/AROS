  * raPrefs/misc: made node edition and save/use/apply of prefs functionnal

#### v7.5 RELEASE ##############################################################

2009-05-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 7.5 release preparations

2009-05-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * prefs/app.c: removed the not required AboutMUI method as calling
    MUIM_Application_AboutMUI should really be enough. This should also solve
    the previously existing problems with the AROS compiles.
  * library/applist.c: instead of always returning 0 in mListCheckSave() for
    AROS we now check if the returned pointer of xget(MUIA_List_Format) is
    NULL or not and thus perform the string compare operation or not. This
    should also catch the case where AROS is failing for the MUIA_List_Format
    get operation.

2009-05-28  Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * German catalog sync'd with "FlexCat .. newctfile ..." and updated.
  * Build German catalog with AROS metamakefile.
  * Copying of icon with AROS metamakefiles
  * Metamakefiles cleaned up
  * Overloading of MUIM_Application_AboutMUI disabled on AROS
    because it crashes when closing the about window.
  * Remaining warnings under AROS removed

2009-05-27  Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * AROS metamakefiles added
  * applist.c: fix for a segfault on AROS because MUIA_List_Format
    isn't get-able in Zune.
  * 64-bit fixes (IPTR, STACKED, UL)

2009-05-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include: updated the mui includes to use "muiaros.h" instead of "mui.h"
    for an AROS compile. Otherwise the binaries won't work, I am afraid.
    In addition a little cleanup in the include directory has been performed.
  
2009-05-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: fixed all remaining compiler warnings when compiling for AROS.

2009-05-24  Alexandre Balaban <alexandre@balaban.fr>

  * locale/french.ct: updated to latest catalog changes

2009-05-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * prefs: slightly updated the About window to match the latest changes and
    to output the correct version string of the preference application.
  * library/prefs.c: added some default settings for OWB, NetSurf, AmiFTP,
    AmiTradeCenter and pftp. If users reset to the default settings of OpenURL
    they should receive a more complete and working set of settings now.

2009-05-20  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * library/api.c: using/applying the prefs always failed due to a missing
    assignment.
  * prefs/*.c: replaced all handcrafted flag checks by macro calls.
  * prefs/popport.c: replaced the clumsy port scanning by a hopefully bullet
    proof version. This new version does not break any Forbid() while scanning
    the public port list.
  * library/utils.c, library/handler.c: replaced the handcrafted message and
    port creation by proper allocations to get rid of the stack based stuff.
    Also shrunk the asynchronous startup message to what is really needed.

2009-05-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * raPrefs: updated the build system of the OS4 reaction preferences to match
    that of our other sub projects. Now the Reaction preferences should work
    as expected on OS4.
  * cmd: updated the sources to be compile/linkable for AROS.
  * include/macros.h: updated to be the global header file for the macro
    definitions of all our subprojects.
  * prefs, misc: now the preference application also properly compiles and
    links for AROS. If it works have to be seen. But it looks quite promising.
  * prefs: fixed MOS compilation by updating the ppcinline header files
  * prefs: converted the build system of the MUI preferences application to
    use the generic Makefile we use with every application. Also converted
    everything to use the SDI headers. OS4 compilation seems to work fine and
    the app seems also to work properly. However, further testing and
    especially work into getting it compiled/linked for OS3 and MOS have to
    be done.

2009-05-19  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * raPrefs/locale.c: fixed possible crash upon program termination.
  * raPrefs: fixed all warnings.
  * Cmd: converted the build system to the usual standard. The commandline tool
    now builds for at least OS3, OS4 and MOS.
  * prefs/OpenURL.c: added debugging initialization.
  * prefs: fixed all remaining issues with the OS3 build. Now the preferences
    program compiles perfectly for OS3 and OS4.
  * prefs: replaced all stccpy() calls by strlcpy().
  * prefs/*.c fixed tons of warnings. At least the OS4 build is done without a
    single warning.
  * library/*.c: replaced all handcrafted flag checks by macro calls.
  * library/api.c, library/utils.c: replace the separate BOOL parameters by a
    combined flags variable.

2009-05-18  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * prefs/popport.c: added a comment about the unsafe Forbid() situation while
    adding items to an MUI list. Just to make sure this is not forgotten.
  * library/handler.c, library/utils.c: replaced the Forbid()/Permit() pair to
    protect access
    to the rexx_use var by usage of the library base semaphore.
  * misc: replaced almost all strcpy() calls by strlcpy(). Also removed the
    custom msnprintf() function as they are longer used.
  * library/api.c: lots of code clean up to make things more readable.
  * misc: replaced several ULONG results by proper BOOL types.
  * misc: added the usual ENTER()/LEAVE()/RETURN() macro calls to all functions.

2009-05-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * library: completely reworked the build system of openurl.library. Now the SDI
    headers are used and a generic libinit.c. All this has been transferred
    from the codesets.library project and should make future improvements more
    easy. Please note, however, that the library needs a lot of testing now
    until we consider a new official release. So please go and see if it works
    with all kind of platforms and applications you have.

2009-05-11  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: lots of type changes to make the source compilable for OS4.
