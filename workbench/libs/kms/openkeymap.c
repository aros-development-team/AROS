	AROS_LH1(struct KeyMapNode *, OpenKeymap,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(STRPTR, name, A0),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct KMSLibrary *, KMSBase, 5, Kms)

/*  FUNCTION
	Open a keymap by name.

    INPUTS
	name - Keymap name. Can be a full pathname or just a name.
	       In the latter case DEVS:Keymaps is assumed to be a
	       path to the file.

    RESULT
    	A pointer to the loaded keymap.

    NOTES
	This function automatically keeps track of loaded keymaps
	via keymap.resource. No more than a single copy of the keymap
	will be loaded.
