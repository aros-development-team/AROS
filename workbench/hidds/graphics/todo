TODO LIST GFX HIDD:

- pass GC to all bitmap rendering calls.
DONE

- Correct handling in AllocBitMap() (BMF_MINPLANES etc)
DONE, but do not check for BMF_MINPLANES; maybe not necessary.

- Implement a temp BM object for planar Amiga bitmaps, to
  avoid cluttering up the graphics_driver.
DONE, but do not handle copying from palettized to truecolor bitmaps

- Implement rendering in bm baseclass only with the help of
pixel format and baseadress.

- Use the above to handle PIXFMT_XXX CGFX bitmaps

- Callback funcs for active window info
DONE. Uses its own task to update active screen info

- ClipRectangle in the bitmap class. Try to implement
some general HIDD_BM_ApplyClipping() method in
the BM baseclass for ease of use by the subclasses.
The clipping should be used for lines, ellipses etc.
DONE. (No HIDD_BM_ApplyClipping though - not usefull)


- Test fast rendering of lines to offscreen HIDD BMs
DONE. Fixed a bug in the X11 BM class. Now works fine.

- Implement rastport WriteMask ie. planemask in the HIDD

- Implement a videoram manager. This includes
cahcing of often-used bitmaps in videoram.
The user should have the ability to decide the
policies for what bitmaps get to be in vram, and
which doesn't, maybe through some callback function.

- Implement the pre_graphics_func()/do_graphics_func()
scheme in XAA. There may not be enough gained by this
for making it worth implement. Also this will
increase the number of methods in the API.



- Not to do with gfx directly, but: Implement general
unix signal handler servers in the UnixIO hidd.
This way several "modules" can use the same
unix signal, and get some code executed when the signal arrives.

- review the ModeID API for future-proofness. There may be more
than sync and pixfmt to return for a modeid in the future.

- Not directly connected to gfx, but implement tag functions that
can parse tas and check against attrchecks, ie. an array of attrcheck
combinations that are legal. The result could
be passed in a IPTR array that would be possible
to index with ao#?.
- Make the above possible for taglists that has multiple attrbases,
and also with the use of default tags, like in GraphicsClass.c/register_modes()
with hirearchial tag "trees".
- implement putimagelut/getimagelut in BM_Class.c
