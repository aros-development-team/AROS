A brief explanation of what BH Format does, and its version history,
can be found at the top of source file `main.c'.  If you are not a
programmer, ignore the rest of the source code and use the compiled
version.

BH Format is free software licensed under the GNU GPL, which you can
find in the file `COPYING'.

If you want to recompile the program, you will need the Geek Gadgets
development environment, or an m68k-amigaos cross-compiler built from
the Geek Gadgets source.  You will probably want to edit Makefile to
select a debugging version.  The file `design.txt' contains a partial
explanation of the structure of the program.
