1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

BH Format is intended to be a compatible replacement for Format
version 40 (AmigaOS up to v3.1) or version version 50 (MorphOS up to 1.4.5)
with important additions:

* It can perform low-level formats (or fake formats, as they usually are)
  on drives larger than 4 GB (AmigaOS v40 Format command will destroy data
  on such a drive).

* It will warn you if the device to be formatted is misconfigured or if
  your file-system or if your disk is too large for your current device
  driver or file-system to handle (only for m68k).

* It allows you to specify file-system type (DosType) and device flags
  directly.  This will be particularly useful in conjunction with firth-
  coming improvements to Francis Swift's XFS package.

* It can create a default disk icon, following the same rules as the
  DefIcons program from NewIcons does.

* It has a GUI (native MorphOS version lacks it), can be used as a module for
  ScalOS desktop.

Also BH Format is a native formatting utility for AROS.

It currently lacks localisation, some error reporting code, and good
documentation.  However, full source code is included and licensed
under the GNU GPL, so perhaps I can get some help with this...

2. INSTALLATION
---------------

1. Copy Format program together with its icon (Format.info) to SYS:System
directory (replacing original program on m68k AmigaOS).

2. On MorphOS: delete (or rename) original MOSSYS:C/Format utility and add
the following command to your S:User-startup file:

Path SYS:System ADD

3. To install as a ScalOS module execute the following command:

MakeLink Scalos:Modules/Format_Disk.module SYS:System/Format

4. HISTORY
----------

12 February 2009

- GUI for selecting device added so it is possible to start from Wanderer.
- Device was not released when formatting was interrupted by user or error.

Version 43.6, 28 June 2008.

Fixed one minor and one major bug:

- Turns on cursor if interrupted by the user
- Cancelling formatting using CTRL-C really works

Version 43.5, 15 June 2008.

Ported to MorphOS and AROS

Does not hold a lock on DosList for a long time

Fixed bug: track buffer size size was undefined when formatting
non-FFS partitions, this could cause memory trashing.

Version 43.4, 9 June 1999.

Fixed 2 medium and 4 minor bugs:

- In the GUI, the logic of the trashcan check-box was inverted.
- Starting Format from Workbench with the icon of an ejected disk
  would result in formatting whatever was currently in the drive
  that the ejected volume was previously in.  It should, and now
  does, ask for the ejected disk to be re-inserted and fail if
  the user refuses.

- The warning about MaxTransfer setting had several words repeated.
- The default disk icon for a file-system type would not be fetched
  unless a file-system type was specified using the CLI DOSTYPE
  keyword.
- The area cleared after formatting the disk and before displaying
  "Initializing disk..." was calculated wrongly (typo).
- The positions of the ticks on the format progress bar were
  calculated slightly wrongly.

Version 43.3, 6 June 1999.

Changed all variable and function names to Hungarian naming
convention (the real thing, not Micro$oft's botched version).
Hopefully this makes the code easy to understand.

Restructured the program so that the GUI and CLI procedures can
share as much code as possible.  Changed error reporting code to
use a single function that will print the message to the console
or display it in a requester depending on how the program was
started.

Wrote almost all the necessary GUI code (search for TODO: in gui.c
to find the missing bits).  The GUI is, of course, font-sensitive.

Added another rule for finding default disk icons - if there isn't
a default icon for the device then the program looks for a default
icon for the file-system type before finally asking icon.library
for the default disk icon.  This should now match DefIcons rules
exactly.

Version 43.2, 25 April 1999.

Added DOSTYPE keyword for specifying file-system type to handlers
that implement multiple non-native types.  Added FLAGS keyword for
specifying non-standard flags when opening the device driver.
Added NOVERIFY switch for disabling format verification (pointless).
Added DISKICON switch for putting a default disk icon on the disk.
Marked comments on unimplemented stuff with "TODO" so that they're
easy to find.

Version 43.1, 13 April 1999.

The product of some hours' hacking last year, and a little
clean-up recently.
