VMM  implements  a  virtual  memory  manager for Amigas with a MMU.  A
localized  user  interface  to  enter  all  parameters  and to disable
certain  tasks  and  load  files  from  using  virtual  memory is also
provided.  For the user interface MUI 2.3 is needed.
Among minor other enhancements V3.3 contains a German documentation.
