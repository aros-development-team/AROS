**************************************************************************

Programs that work when inhibited from using VM:

CycleToMenu

DynamiCache 1.02 (the filesystems of the cached devices have to be
inhibited from using VM; see VMM.guide, section 8)

Distant Suns 5.0
Enforcer V37.42: Should be run before VMM (applies only to 68040).
                 If you are using the ReadMMUConfig program see its
                 docs about Enforcer implications.

FastCache V1.1 (copyright Philip D'Ath): (see comment for PowerCache)
FracBlank

GNU Emacs 18.58:  Emacs does not work with VM because it limits memory
addresses  to  26  bits. This is forbidden on the Amiga and only works
by chance. I will not change anything in VMM to support this.

input.device:   I'm  not  sure  about this.  I got a few unexplainable
crashes, when input.device was allowed to use VM.  It doesn't use much
memory anyway, so it doesn't hurt to forbid VM for this.

Magic File Requester 2.0d

MCP

PowerCache V37.115 (copyright Michael Berg):
It doesn't make much sense for a caching program to use VM.
See the note about the copyback cache in VMM.guide section "Known bugs".

PFS:   PFS  seems  to  have problems with VMM.  I haven't been able to
track  them  down,  but  it seems that as long as you don't use a page
file  on  a PFS partition disabling the PFS filesystem task from using
virtual memory makes the two work together.  Unfortunately it does not
seem to be possible to put the paging file on a pFS partition.

ReqServer

UChess 2.89

Video Toaster 3.1 (NOTE:  Also must run VMM with default set to N N).

xData:  When xData is started before VMM, all xpk libraries have to be
disabled  from code paging.  I don't know why this has to be done, but
doing it this way will cure the problem.


**************************************************************************

Programs which don't work at all together with VMM:


MungWall  V37.64:   Mungwall causes one task in VMM to loop endlessly
                    because Mungwall patches FreeMem so it frees memory
                    with Forbid () set. VMM tries to circumvent problems
                    with a broken Forbid when freeing virtual memory by 
                    deferring the actual free operation until the forbid
                    is over. If you need Mungwall to debug your software
                    you have to turn off VMM.

CacheX 2.0

CPU                 This program seems to cause problems if it is used to
                    map the ROM into Fast RAM. Use another tool like SetCPU.

Emplant

ForceNewLook 1.3

SaferPatches 2.0    (due to a bug in SaferPatches, it forgets to flush
                     the caches)
Enforcer            (applies only to 68030)

TVPaint Junior 1.1

Migraph OCR V1.0

Verte V1.78a

**************************************************************************

Programs  that take over the machine like games, emulators,...  should
be run without VMM.

There  are many programs which don't use very much memory.  Those work
most  of  the time, but won't be listed in this file unless explicitly
requested.
