   NAME
       AllocVMem - Allocate virtual memory

   SYNOPSIS
       memoryblock = AllocVMem (bytesize, attributes)
       D0                       D0        D1

       void *AllocVMem (ULONG,ULONG)

   FUNCTION
       AllocVMem allocates virtual memory just the way AllocMem allocates
       normal memory. 

   INPUTS
	byteSize - the size of the desired block in bytes.  (The operating
		system will automatically round this number to a multiple of
		the system memory chunk size)

	attributes -
	    requirements

		MEMF_CLEAR:	The memory will be initialized to all
     				zeros. This is the only attribute supported.

   RESULT
	memoryBlock - a pointer to the newly allocated memory block.
		If there are no free memory regions large enough to satisfy
		the request, zero will be returned.  The pointer must be
		checked for zero before the memory block may be used!
		The memory block returned is long word aligned.

   WARNING
	The result of any memory allocation MUST be checked, and a viable
	error handling path taken.  ANY allocation may fail if memory has
	been filled.

   NOTE
	If the free list is corrupt, the system will panic with alert
	AN_MemCorrupt, $01000005.

	This function may not be called from interrupts.

   NAME
	FreeVMem -- deallocate virtual memory with knowledge

   SYNOPSIS
	FreeVMem(memoryBlock, byteSize)
              A1           D0

	void FreeVMem(void *,ULONG);

   FUNCTION
	Free a region of virtual memory, returning it to the pool from which
	it came.  Freeing partial blocks back into the pool is unwise.

   NOTE
	If a block of memory is freed twice, the system will Guru. The
	Alert is AN_FreeTwice ($01000009).   If you pass the wrong pointer,
	you will probably see AN_MemCorrupt $01000005.

   INPUTS
	memoryBlock - pointer to the memory block to free
	byteSize - the size of the desired block in bytes.  (The operating
		system will automatically round this number to a multiple of
		the system memory chunk size)

   NAME
	AvailVMem -- virtual memory available given certain requirements

   SYNOPSIS
	size = AvailVMem(attributes)
	D0               D1

	ULONG AvailVMem(ULONG);

   FUNCTION
	This function returns the amount of free virtual memory given 
     certain attributes.

	To find out what the largest block of a particular type is, add
	MEMF_LARGEST into the requirements argument.  Returning the largest
	block is a slow operation.

   WARNING
	Due to the effect of multitasking, the value returned may not
	actually be the amount of free memory available at that instant.

   INPUTS
	requirements - The only valid flag is MEMF_LARGEST, which returns 
                    the size of the largest block matching the 
                    requirements.

   RESULT
	size - total free space remaining (or the largest free block).

   NAME
	AllocVVec -- allocate virtual memory and keep track of the size

   SYNOPSIS
	memoryBlock = AllocVVec(byteSize, attributes)
	D0                      D0        D1

	void *AllocVVec(ULONG, ULONG);

   FUNCTION
	This function works identically to AllocVMem(), but tracks the size
	of the allocation.

	See the AllocVMem() documentation for details.

   WARNING
	The result of any memory allocation MUST be checked, and a viable
	error handling path taken.  ANY allocation may fail if memory has
	been filled.

   NAME
	FreeVVec -- return AllocVVec() memory to the system  (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	FreeVVec(memoryBlock)
              A1

	void FreeVVec(void *);

   FUNCTION
	Free an allocation made by the AllocVVec() call.  The memory will
	be returned to the system pool from which it came.

   NOTE
	If a block of memory is freed twice, the system will Guru. The
	Alert is AN_FreeTwice ($01000009).   If you pass the wrong pointer,
	you will probably see AN_MemCorrupt $01000005.  Future versions may
	add more sanity checks to the memory lists.

   INPUTS
	memoryBlock - pointer to the memory block to free, or NULL.
