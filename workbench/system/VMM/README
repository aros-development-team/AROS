VMM source code package

I  have finally decided  to release  the sources  of VMM,  the virtual
memory manager for the Amiga, to the public. Every now and then people
asked if  I would develop VMM  any further, but  unfortunately I don´t
have the time anymore. I intended to release the sources much earlier,
but anyway, here they are...

The sources are for version 3.3a, the latest released version. You can
do with them whatever you like as long as the conditions stated in the
COPYING file (GNU public license) are regarded.

I´m  not  even  sure  that  the source  code  still  compiles  without
problems, but  then, it  should be fairly  easy to get  things running
again.  GCC has been used to do the latest compiling.

There are translations for quite a number of languages which have been
contributed  by  several  people.  I  recommend to  read  through  the
documentation to understand how VMM works.

If somebody decides to do any  further development I would be happy to
hear  about it.  If  you need  help  do not  hesitate  to contact  me,
although it´s quite some time ago,  since I last looked into the code,
so I might not remember very many details.
