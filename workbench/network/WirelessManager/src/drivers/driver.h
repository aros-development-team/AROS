 * hostapd. The first part of the file defines data structures used in various
 * driver operations. This is followed by the struct wpa_driver_ops that each
 * driver wrapper will beed to define with callback functions for requesting
 * driver operations. After this, there are definitions for driver event
 * reporting with wpa_supplicant_event() and some convenience helper functions
 * that can be used to report events.
