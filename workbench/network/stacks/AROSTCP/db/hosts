; You can include here all computers that you access with your Amiga.
; If you can use nameserver, it is unnecessary. (This file may contain
; only the most important hosts.)
;
; Using nameserver:
; + saves your diskspace (of what there is never enough)
; + protects you from changes in address of computers.
; - if nameserver is down, you can access computers only with its IP
;  number if it is not in your hosts file.
