	/* There is a problem with the relay agent information option,
	   which is that in order for a normal relay agent to append
	   this option, the relay agent has to have been involved in
	   getting the packet from the client to the server.  Note
	   that this is the software entity known as the relay agent,
	   _not_ the hardware entity known as a router in which the
	   relay agent may be running, so the fact that a router has
	   forwarded a packet does not mean that the relay agent in
	   the router was involved.

	   So when the client is in INIT or INIT-REBOOT or REBINDING
	   state, the relay agent gets to tack on its options, but
	   when it's not, the relay agent doesn't get to do this,
	   which means that any decisions the DHCP server may make
	   based on the agent options will be made incorrectly.  

	   We work around this in the following way: if this is a
	   DHCPREQUEST and doesn't have relay agent information
	   options, we see if there's an existing lease for this IP
	   address and this client that _does_ have stashed agent
	   options.   If so, then we tack those options onto the
	   packet as if they came from the client.   Later on, when we
	   are deciding whether to steal the agent options from the
	   packet, if the agent options stashed on the lease are the
	   same as those stashed on the packet, we don't steal them -
	   this ensures that the client never receives its agent
	   options. */

		   one of our IP addresses.   This is probably not a big
		   deal, but it's theoretically an issue.

		   The reason we care about this is that if both servers

	/* If a client on a given network REQUESTs a lease on an
	   address on a different network, NAK it.  If the Requested
	   Address option was used, the protocol says that it must
	   have been broadcast, so we can trust the source network
	   information.

	   If ciaddr was specified and Requested Address was not, then
	   we really only know for sure what network a packet came from
	   if it came through a BOOTP gateway - if it came through an
	   IP router, we'll just have to assume that it's cool.

	   If we don't think we know where the packet came from, it
	   came through a gateway from an unknown network, so it's not
	   from a RENEWING client.  If we recognize the network it
	   *thinks* it's on, we can NAK it even though we don't
	   recognize the network it's *actually* on; otherwise we just
	   have to ignore it.

	   We don't currently try to take advantage of access to the
	   raw packet, because it's not available on all platforms.
	   So a packet that was unicast to us through a router from a
	   RENEWING client is going to look exactly like a packet that
	   was broadcast to us from an INIT-REBOOT client.

	   Since we can't tell the difference between these two kinds
	   of packets, if the packet appears to have come in off the
	   local wire, we have to treat it as if it's a RENEWING
	   client.  This means that we can't NAK a RENEWING client on
	   the local wire that has a bogus address.  The good news is
	   that we won't ACK it either, so it should revert to INIT
	   state and send us a DHCPDISCOVER, which we *can* work with.

	   Because we can't detect that a RENEWING client is on the
	   wrong wire, it's going to sit there trying to renew until
	   it gets to the REBIND state, when we *can* NAK it because
	   the packet will get to us through a BOOTP gateway.  We
	   shouldn't actually see DHCPREQUEST packets from RENEWING
	   clients on the wrong wire anyway, since their idea of their
	   local router will be wrong.  In any case, the protocol
	   doesn't really allow us to NAK a DHCPREQUEST from a
