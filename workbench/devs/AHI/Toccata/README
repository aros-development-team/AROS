This is a toccata.library emulation, never finished, that I wrote in 1997.
Teemu Suikki lated improved it and used it in the Delfina distribution.

The original idea was to install a commodity when the library was loaded,
so the user could select what AHI modes (s)he wanted to use.  In this
version, the modes are hardcoded into the library (which is why the Delfina
version does no work with AHI 5; it uses the now removed "Fast" modes).

It currently compiles and assembles with SAS/C and PhxAss.
