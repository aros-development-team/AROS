CMI8738 AHI driver for AROS
-------------------------------------

Please check if the output in the AHI prefs is set
to Front (5.7) or "Line Out" (5.8 or higher) if you
don't hear sound.

The OS4 version of the driver has been tested with:

- Sweex 5.1
- Hercules Muse
- MicroA1
- Terratec Aureon 5.1 Fun and 5.1 PCI

It is more than likely that it will work with other CMI8738 based cards.

Don't forget to set up Unit 0 in the AHI prefs (freq=44100 Hz,
Channels = 10 or more).

Please send bug reports to info@audio-evolution.com.

History:

5.18 (20 Jul 2011):
    - Ported to AROS
    
5.17 (04 Nov 2006):
    - Initialization code now locks the device

5.16 (06 Apr 2006):
    - Muted FM

5.15 (16 Feb 2006):
    - Works with old and new memory system

5.14 (07 Jan 2006):
    - Works with new memory system

5.13 (10 Dec 2005):
    - Handles mono modes correctly now.

5.12 (18 Sep 2005):
    - Did a 'greater than' instead of 'greater or equal than' test to
      determine which buffer to choose, which could result in any kind
      of crackling. Odd that it only occured here at sample rates other
      than 44100 Hz.
    - Fixed the date in the version string

5.11 (13 Sep 2005):
    - Fix involving recovery of lost interrupts. The sound could get
      distorted after Grim Reapers or when starting the network.
      Distortion will still take place for a short while, but it
      will recover from that.

5.10: test version

5.9 (04 Sep 2005):
    - The mic input now has a default gain of +20dB. You can turn this
      on and off by using the tool 'cmiboost' in the C directory:
      'cmiboost 1' turns it on and 'cmiboost 0' turns it off.

5.8 (22 Aug 2005):
    - CD playback stopped when playing a PCM sound. Fixed.
    - Changed name of first output to "Line Out" instead of
      "Front"

5.7 (20 Aug 2005):
    - Added S/PDIF out support. S/PDIF in doesn't work yet.

5.6 (15 Aug 2005):
    - Volumes were all set to max, which wasn't the intention.
      When you want to set volumes of CD etc., please user Mixer 1.12.

5.5 (12 Aug 2005):
    - Input selection
    - Output volume control
    - Aux support


5.4 (02 Oct 2004):

    - Code clean-up

5.3: Added reset handler to stop the sound when doing a software reset
