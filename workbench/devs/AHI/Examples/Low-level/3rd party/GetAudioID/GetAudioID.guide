@{u}WHAT DOES IT DO?@{uu}

This program opens a requester asking for the desired audio mode and mixing
frequency. It then returns the selected ID and frequency as a text string.
Optional @{"formatting" link Examples} is supported.
@endnode

@node Compatibility "What is GetAudioID compatible with?"
@prev Basics
@next CLIStart

@{u}COMPATIBILITY@{uu}

@{b}GetAudioID@{ub} requires Kickstart 2.04 or newer and ahi.device version
1 or newer.

@endnode

@node CLIStart "Starting GetAudioID from a CLI/Shell"
@prev Compatibility
@next WBStart

@{u}STARTING FROM CLI/SHELL@{uu}

You can start the program from a CLI/SHELL/etc. and @{"Workbench" link "WBStart"}.

To run the program, enter the following into your CLI/SHELL/etc.

	1> GetAudioID DEC=DECIMAL/S,TITLE/K,POSITIVE/K,NEGATIVE/K,
	   LFORMAT/K,PUBSCREEN/K:

	Where:  DECIMAL prints the AudioID in decimal notation instead of
		the default hexadecimal one. Use DEC as an abbreviation.

		TITLE specifies the window title for the requester. Useful
		for scripts. Keyword required.

		POSITIVE specifies the gadget text for the positive gadget
		(the 'OK' button). Useful for scripts. Keyword required.

		NEGATIVE specifies the gadget text for the negative gadget
		(the 'Cancel' button). Useful for scripts. Keyword required.

		LFORMAT allows you to specify an alternate @{"formatting" link Examples}
		string for the result. Useful for scripts. Keyword
		required. Double quotes may be required.

		PUBSCREEN specifies the public screen name where the
		requester should open. Keyword required.

@node WBStart "Starting from the Workbench"
@prev CLIStart
@next Examples

@{u}STARTING FROM WORKBENCH@{uu}

From Workbench, start the program like any other by double-clicking on its
icon. If, however, you would like to specify a @{"formatting string" link Examples} or
public screen, use the tool types. This is done by clicking once on the icon
and selecting 'Information...' from the 'Icons' menu in the Workbench. Then
change the tool types accordingly (please refer to your User Manual, if
necessary). Please take care with upper- and lowercase letters! The inputs ARE
case-sensitive. If a public screen name isn't given, @{b}GetAudioID@{ub} will
use the default public screen.

Below is a list of available tool types and there usage:

TOOL TYPE	VALUE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
DECIMAL		<None>
TITLE		<Window title for the requester>
POSITIVE	<Text for positive gadget (the 'OK' button)>
NEGATIVE	<Text for negative gadget (the 'Cancel' button)>
LFORMAT		<@{"Formatting string" link Examples} for the result>
PUBSCREEN	<Name of the public screen to open on>

Examples:

	DECIMAL
	TITLE=Choose sound mode
	POSITIVE=Okay
	NEGATIVE=Nope
	LFORMAT=The selected mode ID was %ld, mixing frequency of %ld.
	PUBSCREEN=My_Public_Screen.1

or simply

	PUBSCREEN=Workbench

@{u}HOW TO USE THE FORMATTING STRING@{uu}

To change the output of @{b}GetAudioID@{ub}, use the LFORMAT option. It
works like the LFORMAT option of the system command List. You may enter any
text you wish where the first occurance of "%ld" or "%lx" will be replaced
with the ModeID selected and the second with the mixing frequency. Use "%%"
to print a procent sign. @{b}NOTE:@{ub} You must use the "l" after the
procent sign and no more than two occurances of "%ld" or "%lx" are allowed.

@{u}EXAMPLES:@{uu}

LFORMAT=The AudioID for the selected mode is 0x%08lx (hex) and the mixing
frequency is %ld Hz.

LFORMAT="ID=$%lx MIX=$%lx"

@node Errors "Error messages displayed by GetAudioID"
@prev Examples
@next Bugs

@{u}ERROR MESSAGES@{uu}

The @{b}GetAudioID@{ub} program will display necessary error messages. If a library
can't be opened, the user will be informed. I HATE PROGRAMS THAT DON'T TELL
WHAT-THE-HELL IS GOING ON! That clear? If @{b}GetAudioID@{ub} doesn't give any 
output something has gone terribly wrong or you're running with an old
Kickstart. Even in this case the return code will be set to -20 (FAIL).
