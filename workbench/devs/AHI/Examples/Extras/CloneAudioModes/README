This is a small tool to create new mode files from an existing
one. For audio drivers that can handle multiple boards, each board
requires a mode file that defines the audio modes.


*** NOTE! *** Not all audio drivers support multiple boards! *** NOTE! ***


Usage: CloneAudioModes <Template mode file> <New mode file> [<Board number>]

If <Board number> is not specified, the board ID will just be increased
by one in the new mode file.

Example: The mode file "DEVS:AudioModes/EMU10KX" defines the following
modes for the SoundBlaster Live! sound card:

 0x001E0001 "EMU10kx:HiFi 16 bit mono"
 0x001E0002 "EMU10kx:HiFi 16 bit stereo++"
 0x001E0003 "EMU10kx:16 bit mono"
 0x001E0004 "EMU10kx:16 bit stereo++"

To use a second SB Live! card, you must create a new mode file
"DEVS:AudioModes", preferably called "EMU10KX-2":

1> CloneAudioModes DEVS:AudioModes/EMU10KX DEVS:AudioModes/EMU10KX-2

This will create the following modes:

 0x001E1001 "EMU10kx-2:HiFi 16 bit mono"
 0x001E1002 "EMU10kx-2:HiFi 16 bit stereo++"
 0x001E1003 "EMU10kx-2:16 bit mono"
 0x001E1004 "EMU10kx-2:16 bit stereo++"

To create mode files for a third card, use either one of the following
commands:

1> CloneAudioModes DEVS:AudioModes/EMU10KX-2 DEVS:AudioModes/EMU10KX-3

or

1> CloneAudioModes DEVS:AudioModes/EMU10KX DEVS:AudioModes/EMU10KX-3 3

When using more than one sound card, one might find it a bit annoying
that the second sound card shows up before the first (because of the
ASCII sort order) CloneAudioModes can be used to rename the modes in
the original mode file to end in "-1":

1> CloneAudioModes DEVS:AudioModes/EMU10KX DEVS:AudioModes/EMU10KX-1 1
1> Delete DEVS:AudioModes/EMU10KX
