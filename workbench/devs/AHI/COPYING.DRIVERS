As a special exception of the LGPL, AHI sound card drivers do not
need to be GPL or LGPL compatible. Any license is acceptable, and the
source code does not have to be provided.

That being said, driver authors are strongly encouraged to release
their drivers as open source software, for the benefit of the whole
Amiga community.
