# French PC105 keyboard.
#
# Each key has 3 lines of text. First  line: <SHIFT> + key.
#                               Middle line: key alone.
#                               Third  line: <RALT> + <SHIFT> + key followed by <RALT> + key.
#
# Numeric pad: "(" <something> ")" is used to indicate that this key is on
# the numeric pad, unless the name already implies, that it is on the numeric
# pad. The third line on the numeric pad shows *not*, what you get if you press
# <RALT> + key, but what you get if NUMLOCK is off!
#
# Some keys might be missing on your keyboard:
#
# - The key left of backspace might be missing and instead you will have a larger backspace key. 
#
# - The key right of LSHIFT (between LSHIFT and Y or Z on most keyboards) might be missing
#   and instead you will have a larger LSHIFT key.
#
# - The key below backspace might be "missing" and instead be part of the RETURN key.
#
# - The key left of RETURN might be missing, and instead you will have a larger RETURN key.
