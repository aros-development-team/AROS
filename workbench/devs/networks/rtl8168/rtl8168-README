This is an AROS "SANA-2" NIC Driver for RealTek Gigabit Ethernet
controllers with PCI-Express interface.

Based on the GPL RealTek r8168 NIC driver

Development sponsored by ClusterUK - who provided the iMica Hardware
it was primarily designed for.

supported NIC's:
    0x10ec,0x8168  - RealTek RTL8168B/8111B
    0x10ec,0x8168  - RealTek RTL8168C/8111C
    0x10ec,0x8168  - RealTek RTL8168CP/8111CP
    0x10ec,0x8168  - RealTek RTL8168D/8111D

TODO/Limitations/Known Issues:
* Fix shutdown (currently doesnt cleanup/shutdown)
* Handle Rx more efficiently (reduce  processing in int handler)
* Fix multicast hashlist
* Make sure all stats get recorded correctly.
* Support for Jumbo frames.
* Support for checksum offloading.
* Move generic defines to generic driver header files.

NOTES
* Some Linux kernel rtl8168 drivers have been known to wipe the eeprom
MAC address. If this affects you, then remove all power from your system
(laptops must have their battery removed, desktops should be unplugged
from the mains) and it should be restored.
