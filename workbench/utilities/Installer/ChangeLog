0001
- parse fixed file and sort strings into tree structure
- printf() the structure as "simulation" of execution

0002
- free malloc'ed memory after successfully executing string

0003
- split one sourcefile into multiple included into main file
- removed debug information on parsing

0004
- always check for (malloc()!=NULL) else exit(-1)
- use "#warning FIXME: blah" to mark bugs/missing sections/hacks
- introduced files BUGS and ChangeLog

0005
- now the sources compile into modules
- start interpreting commands

0006
- fixed problem that startup.o has to be the first objectfile

- moved content of commands.h into execute.h and deleted commands.h :-(

0009
- added support for LINUX only compilation
  (for testing issues only - will go away soon)

- added collection of arguments for _STRING ( "..." ... ) to pass
  to RawDoFmt()
- fixed a bug which caused parse_script() to have an empty ScriptArg at
  end of lists, now if RBRACK is detected the last element is deleted
  and pointers made valid (except if it would be the one and only!!!
  In this case ->parent->cmd has to be set to NULL as well etc.
  (Maybe we should terminate if braces are empty?) )
- added missing "@" for preset variables

0014
- left out previous version due to superstition ;-)
- fixed bug which allocated one byte too less 8-|
  (hope this fixes previous problems...), marked those bugs as fixed

  cmd and converts intval to strings if arg is NULL ( you can specify a
  separating character )
  "abort" "cat" "exit" "welcome" "working" make use of this function
- reinitialized (freed/set to Null) return values collectively

0025
- added "substr" "user" "debug"
- started work on parameters
  . get_parameters() supports boolean parameters
  . "exit" understands (quiet)

  "(procedure ...)" key puts the function into the active list
  replaces existing function

0038
