BUG00001 fixed
fseek() has a bug -- check in future
As long as this isn't fixed everything has to be separated by whitespaces!

BUG00002
Strings are limited to MAXARGSIZE which is 1024 ATM or if concatenated
(with <MAXARGSIZE sub-strings) up to 256k.

BUG00003
abort in abort causes some problems. Is this allowed, btw?
Anyway: an aborted askbool with trap->askbool hangs the system
(circular dependancy in gadgets)

BUG00004 fixed
Get rid of malloc/realloc/free and use AllocMem/FreeMem instead.
SOLUTION: Use AllocVec()/FreeVec()
	  realloc is fixed by a new function in alib: ReAllocVec()
	-> missing on original AmigaOS

BUG00005
FileRequester crashes AROS when in expert mode.  Does not happen if any
program has successfully opened a FileRequester before.

BUG00006 fixed
GUI of askchoice crashes.
