Snoopy
======

Simple system monitor. It patches nearly the same functions as the famous
SnoopDos. It prints the parameters of several library functions with the
kprintf function. You can see the output either in the Shell from which
you have started AROS or in Sashimi.

Usage
=====

Select the functions you want to monitor and press the 'Save' or 'Use' button.
Press 'Undo' to revert to the state before your latest 'Save' or 'Use' click.
'Reset' resets to some default settings.
'Save' stores the settings in envarc:snoopy.prefs.
You should normally not use the 'Cancel' button. It can lead to
problems when another program patches the functions which have
already been patched by Snoopy.

TODO
====

NameFromLock crashes. Therefore the CurrentDir patch doesn't print
the directory name and the option ShowFullPath doesn't work.

Implement missing settings.
