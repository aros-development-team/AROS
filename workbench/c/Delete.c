    NAME

    Delete

    SYNOPSIS
    
    Delete { (name | pattern) } [ALL] [QUIET] [FORCE]

    LOCATION

	Workbench/c

    FUNCTION

    Deletes files and directories. You may delete several files and directories
    by listing them separately or by using wildcards. To abort a multiple
    delete, press CTRL-C. Delete will notify the user of which files it
    weren't able to delete.
        Delete cannot delete directories which are not empty unless the
    ALL option is used. To suppresss file and directory names from being
    printed while deleted use the QUIET option. If the 'd' protection bit
    is cleared for a file or directory, it may not be deleted unless the
    FORCE option is used.

    INPUTS

    FILE/M/A  --  files or directories to delete (may contain patterns)
    ALL/S     --  recursively delete dirctories
    QUIET/S   --  don't print which files/directories were deleted
    FORCE/S   --  delete files/directories even if they are protected from
                  deletion

    RESULT

    NOTES

    EXAMPLE

    Delete RAM:T/#? ALL FORCE

    Deletes all directories and files recursively in the directory RAM:T
    even if they are protected from deletion.
