The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking

	He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
	In his youth or a dream he can't be precise
	He's chained forever to a world that's departed
	It's not enough it's not enough

His blood has frozen & curdled with fright
His knees have trembled & given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

		One world one soul
		Time pass the river roll

	And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
	And silent replies that swirl invitation
	Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
	A grim intimation of what is to be

There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night
and there's dust in my eyes that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
of promises broken
