    NAME */

int wmemcmp(
    
 /*  SYNOPSIS */     
    const wchar_t * s1, 
    const wchar_t * s2, 
    size_t n)

/*  FUNCTION
         Compares the first n wide characters of the object pointed to by s1 
         to the first n wide characters of the object pointed to by s2.

    INPUTS
        s1 - Pointer to block of elements of type wchar_t.
        s2 - Pointer to block of elements of type wchar_t.
        n  - Number of elements of type wchar_t to compare.

    RESULT
        Returns an integral value indicating the relationship between the content of the blocks:
        A zero value indicates that the contents of both memory blocks are equal.
        A value greater than zero indicates that the first wide character that does not match 
        in both memory blocks has a greater value in ptr1 than in ptr2; 
        And a value less than zero indicates the opposite.
