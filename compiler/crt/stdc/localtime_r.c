        struct tm * localtime_r (

/*  SYNOPSIS */
        const time_t * tt,
        struct tm * tm)

/*  FUNCTION
        The localtime_r() function converts the calendar time tt (assumed to
        be UTC) to broken-down time representation, expressed users local
        timezone.

        The members of the tm structure are:

        tm_sec - The number of seconds after the minute, normally in
                 the range 0 to 59, but can be up to 61 to allow for leap
                 seconds.

        tm_min - The number of minutes after the hour, in the range 0 to 59.

        tm_hour - The number of hours past midnight, in the range 0 to 23.

        tm_mday - The day of the month, in the range 1 to 31.

        tm_mon - The number of months since January, in the range 0 to 11.

        tm_year - The number of years since 1900.

        tm_wday - The number of days since Sunday, in the range 0 to 6.

        tm_yday - The number of days since January 1, in the range  0 to 365.

        tm_isdst - A flag that indicates whether daylight saving time
                   is in effect at the time described. The value is positive
                   if daylight saving time is in effect, zero if it is not,
                   and negative if the information is not available.

    INPUTS
        tt - A time in seconds from the 1. Jan 1970
        tm - A struct tm to store the result in

    RESULT
        The pointer passed in tm.

    NOTES

    EXAMPLE
        time_t    tt;
        struct tm tm;

        // Get time
        time (&tt);

        // Break time up
        localtime_r (&tt, &tm);
