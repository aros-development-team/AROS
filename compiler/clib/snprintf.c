    NAME */
#include <stdio.h>

        int snprintf (

/*  SYNOPSIS */
        char       * str,
        size_t       n,
        const char * format,
        ...)

/*  FUNCTION
        C99 says:The snprintf function is equivalent to fprintf, except that the output is
        written into an array (specified by argument s) rather than to a stream. If
        n is zero, nothing is written, and s may be a null pointer. Otherwise,
        output characters beyond the n-1st are discarded rather than being written
        to the array, and a null character is written at the end of the characters
        actually written into the array. If copying takes place between objects
        that overlap, the behavior is undefined.

    INPUTS
        str - The formatted string is written into this variable. You
              must make sure that it is large enough to contain the
              result.
        n -   At most n characters are written into the string. This
              includes the final 0.
        format - Format string as described above
        ... - Arguments for the format string

    RESULT
        The snprintf function returns the number of characters that would have been
        written had n been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null
        character, or a negative value if an encoding error occurred. Thus, the
        null-terminated output has been completely written if and only if the
        returned value is nonnegative and less than n.
