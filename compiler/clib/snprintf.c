    NAME */
#include <stdio.h>

int snprintf (

/*  SYNOPSIS */
    char       * str,
    size_t       n,
    const char * format,
    ...)

/*  FUNCTION
    C99 says:The snprintf function is equivalent to fprintf, except that the output is
    written into an array (specified by argument s) rather than to a stream. If
    n is zero, nothing is written, and s may be a null pointer. Otherwise,
    output characters beyond the n-1st are discarded rather than being written
    to the array, and a null character is written at the end of the characters
    actually written into the array. If copying takes place between objects
    that overlap, the behavior is undefined.

    INPUTS
    str - The formatted string is written into this variable. You
          must make sure that it is large enough to contain the
          result.
    n -   At most n characters are written into the string. This
          includes the final 0.
    format - Format string as described above
    ... - Arguments for the format string

    RESULT
    The snprintf function returns the number of characters that would have been
    written had n been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null
    character, or a negative value if an encoding error occurred. Thus, the
    null-terminated output has been completely written if and only if the
    returned value is nonnegative and less than n.
