int vsnprintf (

/*  SYNOPSIS */
    char        * str,
    size_t      n,
    const char * format,
    va_list      args)

/*  FUNCTION
    Format a list of arguments and put them into the string str.
    The function makes sure that no more than n characters (including
    the terminal 0 byte) are written into str.
    If n is zero, nothing is written, and s may be a null pointer. Otherwise,
    output characters beyond the n-1st are discarded rather than being written
    to the array, and a null character is written at the end of the characters
    actually written into the array. If copying takes place between objects
    that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
    
    INPUTS
    str - The formatted result is stored here
    n - The size of str
    format - A printf() format string.
    args - A list of arguments for the format string.

    RESULT
    Function returns the number of characters that would have been
    written had n been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null
    character, or a negative value if an encoding error occurred. Thus, the
    null-terminated output has been completely written if and only if the
    returned value is nonnegative and less than n.
