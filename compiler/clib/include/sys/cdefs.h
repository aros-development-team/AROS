    IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT etc

    If you do not understand what the following code does, then please do
    not change it. Basically various standards (POSIX, ISO C, etc) are
    very pedantic about what is visible and what is not.

    The following code from FreeBSD's cdefs.h basically does all the
    standards check. That is where the BSD licenced part comes from above.

    This should be compatible with *BSD, and hopefully Linux as well.
    Other forms of UNIX might have some more trouble.
*****************************************************************************/

/*-
 * POSIX.1 requires that the macros we test be defined before any standard
 * header file is included.
 *
 * Here's a quick run-down of the versions:
 *  defined(_POSIX_SOURCE)              1003.1-1988
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 1                1003.1-1990
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 2                1003.2-1992 C Language Binding Option
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199309           1003.1b-1993
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199506           1003.1c-1995, 1003.1i-1995,
 *                                      and the omnibus ISO/IEC 9945-1: 1996
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200112           1003.1-2001
 *
 * In addition, the X/Open Portability Guide, which is now the Single UNIX
 * Specification, defines a feature-test macro which indicates the version of
 * that specification, and which subsumes _POSIX_C_SOURCE.
 *
 * Our macros begin with two underscores to avoid namespace screwage.
