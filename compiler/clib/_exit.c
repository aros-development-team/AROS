	void _exit (

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	int code)

/*  FUNCTION
	Terminates the running program immediately. The code is returned to 
        the program which has called the running program. In contrast to
        exit(), this function does not call user exit-handlers added with 
        atexit() or on_exit(). It does, however, close open filehandles.

    INPUTS
	code - Exit code. 0 for success, other values for failure.

    RESULT
	None. This function does not return.

    NOTES
        This function must not be used in a shared library or in a threaded
        application.

   EXAMPLE

    BUGS
        Currently, this function *does* trigger user exit-handlers to be 
        called.
