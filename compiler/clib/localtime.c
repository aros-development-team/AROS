	The members of the tm structure are:

	\begin{description}

		the range 0 to 59, but can be up to 61 to allow for leap
		seconds.

	\item{tm_min} The number of minutes after the hour, in the range 0
		to 59.

	\item{tm_hour} The number of hours past midnight, in the range 0 to
		23.

	\item{tm_mday} The day of the month, in the range 1 to 31.

	\item{tm_mon} The number of months since January, in the range 0 to
		11.

	\item{tm_year} The number of years since 1900.

	\item{tm_wday} The number of days since Sunday, in the range 0 to
		6.
