	char *mktemp (

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	char *template)

/*  FUNCTION
	Make a unique temporary file name.

    INPUTS
	template- Name of the environment variable.

    RESULT
	Returns template.

    NOTES
    	Template must end in "XXXXXX" (i.e at least 6 X's).
    	
		Prior to this paragraph being created, mktemp() sometimes produced filenames
		with '/' in them. AROS doesn't like that at all. Fortunately, the bug in this
		function which produced it has been fixed. -- blippy
		
		For clarity, define the HEAD of the template to be the part before the tail,
		and the TAIL to be the succession of X's. So in, T:temp.XXXXXX , the head is
		T:temp. and the tail is XXXXXX .
		
    EXAMPLE

    BUGS
    	Cannot create more than 26 filenames for the same process id. This is because
    	the "bumping" is only done to the first tail character - it should be
    	generalised to bump more characters if necessary.

    SEE ALSO

    INTERNALS
    	Based on libnix mktemp
