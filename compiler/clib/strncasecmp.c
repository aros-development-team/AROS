	int strncasecmp (

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	const char * str1,
	const char * str2,
	size_t	     n)

/*  FUNCTION
	Calculate str1 - str2 ignoring case. Upto n characters are taken
	into account.

    INPUTS
	str1, str2 - Strings to compare

    RESULT
	The difference of the strings. The difference is 0, if both are
	equal, < 0 if str1 < str2 and > 0 if str1 > str2. Note that
	it may be greater then 1 or less than -1.

    NOTES
	This function is not part of a library and may thus be called
	any time.
