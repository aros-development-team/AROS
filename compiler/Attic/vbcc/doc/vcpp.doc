The preprocessor vcpp was taken from the lcc-distribution. I made some
very minor changes to the source and compiled it with vbcc.
To rebuilt the Amiga version #define AMIGA and link with the support-routines
in mysupport.c.

Attached is the copyright notice from the lcc-distribution (note that
apart from vcpp no other part of this distribution falls under this
license - especially notice the difference between the builtin
preprocessor of vbcc and vcpp).

lcc is not public-domain software, shareware, and it is not protected
by a `copyleft' agreement, like the code from the Free Software
Foundation.

lcc is available free for your personal research and instructional use
under the `fair use' provisions of the copyright law. You may,
however, redistribute the lcc in whole or in part provided you
acknowledge its source and include this COPYRIGHT file.

You may not sell lcc or any product derived from it in which it is a
significant part of the value of the product. Using the lcc front end
to build a C syntax checker is an example of this kind of product.

You may use parts of lcc in products as long as you charge for only
those components that are entirely your own and you acknowledge the use
of lcc clearly in all product documentation and distribution media. You
must state clearly that your product uses or is based on parts of lcc
and that lcc is available free of charge. You must also request that
bug reports on your product be reported to you. Using the lcc front
end to build a C compiler for the Motorola 88000 chip and charging for
and distributing only the 88000 code generator is an example of this
kind of product.

Using parts of lcc in other products is more problematic. For example,
using parts of lcc in a C++ compiler could save substantial time and
effort and therefore contribute significantly to the profitability of
the product. This kind of use, or any use where others stand to make a
profit from what is primarily our work, is subject to negotiation.
