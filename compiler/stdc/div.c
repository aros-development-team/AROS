/*  SYNOPSIS */
	int numer,

/*  FUNCTION
 	Compute quotient en remainder of two int variables

    INPUTS
        numer = the numerator
        denom = the denominator

    RESULT
        a struct with two ints quot and rem with
        quot = numer / denom and rem = numer % denom.

        typedef struct div_t {
            int quot;
            int rem;
        } div_t;

     * The ANSI standard says that |r.quot| <= |n/d|, where
     * n/d is to be computed in infinite precision.  In other
     * words, we should always truncate the quotient towards
     * 0, never -infinity.
     *
     * Machine division and remainer may work either way when
     * one or both of n or d is negative.  If only one is
     * negative and r.quot has been truncated towards -inf,
     * r.rem will have the same sign as denom and the opposite
     * sign of num; if both are negative and r.quot has been
     * truncated towards -inf, r.rem will be positive (will
     * have the opposite sign of num).  These are considered
     * `wrong'.
     *
     * If both are num and denom are positive, r will always
     * be positive.
     *
     * This all boils down to:
     *      if num >= 0, but r.rem < 0, we got the wrong answer.
     * In that case, to get the right answer, add 1 to r.quot and
     * subtract denom from r.rem.
