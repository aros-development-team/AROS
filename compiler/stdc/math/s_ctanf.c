/*							ctanf()
 *
 *	Complex circular tangent
 *
 *
 *
 * SYNOPSIS:
 *
 * void ctanf();
 * cmplxf z, w;
 *
 * ctanf( &z, &w );
 *
 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * If
 *     z = x + iy,
 *
 * then
 *
 *           sin 2x  +  i sinh 2y
 *     w  =  --------------------.
 *            cos 2x  +  cosh 2y
 *
 * On the real axis the denominator is zero at odd multiples
 * of PI/2.  The denominator is evaluated by its Taylor
 * series near these points.
 *
 *
 * ACCURACY:
 *
 *                      Relative error:
 * arithmetic   domain     # trials      peak         rms
 *    IEEE      -10,+10     30000       3.3e-7       5.1e-8
