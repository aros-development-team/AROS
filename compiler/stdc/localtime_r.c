/*  SYNOPSIS */
	const time_t * tt,
        struct tm * tm)

/*  FUNCTION
	Splits the system time in seconds into a structure.
	The members of the tm structure are:

	tm_sec - The number of seconds after the minute, normally in
		 the range 0 to 59, but can be up to 61 to allow for leap
		 seconds.

	tm_min - The number of minutes after the hour, in the range 0 to 59.

	tm_hour - The number of hours past midnight, in the range 0 to 23.

	tm_mday - The day of the month, in the range 1 to 31.

	tm_mon - The number of months since January, in the range 0 to 11.

	tm_year - The number of years since 1900.

	tm_wday - The number of days since Sunday, in the range 0 to 6.

	tm_yday - The number of days since January 1, in the range  0 to 365.

		   and negative if the information is not available.

    INPUTS
	tt - A time in seconds from the 1. Jan 1970
        tm - A struct tm to store the result in

        The pointer passed in tm.
