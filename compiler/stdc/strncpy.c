	char * strncpy (

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	char	   * dest,
	const char * src,
	size_t	     n)

/*  FUNCTION
	Copy a string. Works like an assignment "dest=src;". At most
	n characters are copied.

    INPUTS
	dest - The string is copied into this variable. Make sure it is
		large enough.
	src - This is the new contents of dest.
	n - How many characters to copy at most. If the string src is
		smaller than that, only strlen(str)+1 bytes are copied.

    RESULT
	dest.

    NOTES
	No check is made that dest is large enough for src.
