    <dir>alib</dir>
    The source for the amiga.lib. This link library
        contains small utility functions which didn't made it
        into a shared library.

    <dir>aros</dir>
    The source for aros.lib. This link library
        contains special functions which allow to write
        portable code.

    <dir>clib</dir>
    <p>The source for AROS' c.lib. This link library
        contains the standard ANSI C (and some more)
        library functions like <code>printf()</code>,
	<code>strcpy()</code>, etc.</p>

        <p>The directory also contains the includes for ANSI C.</p>

    <dir>include</dir>
    This directory contains all AROS specific
        includes as well as all Amiga includes which have
        been modified for AROS. Note that these files are
        searched *before* the files in
        <filename>amiga/include/</filename>. Most people will notice
        this when they compile some program which uses a
        function which has not yet been implemented in
        AROS. The compiler will complain about a function
        without a prototype despite the fact that it is in
        <filename>amiga/include/clib/*_protos.h</filename>. That's
        because it doesn't look there and if you ever get
        an error like this, have a look into include first.
</item>
<item>
    <dir>autoinit</dir>
    The sources for autoinit.lib, a library that let's you forget
    about the initialization of whatever you want, opening and
    closing libraries included.
