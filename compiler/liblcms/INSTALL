  LittleCMS 1.09 - Installation guide

  Configuration
  =============

  All configuration is done by commenting/uncommenting a set
  of toggles placed on the beginning of file lcms.h, placed
  on directory 'include'.

  Normally, there is no need to touch anything. Only make sure
  to set properly the NON_WINDOWS toggle if you are using the 
  engine in non MS-Windows environments (set by default), and 
  USE_BIG_ENDIAN if your machine does use this convention. 
  Remaining toggles does control optimization degree. If your 
  compiler does support the new __int64 or "long long" type, 
  (gcc does) you can gain speed by defining the USE_INT64 toggle.


  Installation 
  ============

  Unpack & untar the tarball (you already did!) and then type 

    make

  This will run the testbed program as well. If you want to install 
  the package, type 

    make install

  This does copy lcms.h and icc34.h into /usr/include and liblcms.a 
  into /usr/lib

  There is a 'install.gcc' script that simply invokes 'make -s install'
  this is just to keep compatibility with old 1.06 version.


  For cleaning object and binaries files type 'make clean'

  There are these targets on Makefile:

      install: Does install package
      test:    builds and executes testbed program
      clean:   Deletes object & binary files
      utils:   see below


  Tifficc & jpegicc
  =================

  If you have libz, libtiff and libjpeg installed, there are
  some additional utilities for converting images using icc profiles.
  Since lcms doesn't require these libraries to work, and in order
  to minimize the dependency carrousel, these utilities are not builded 
  by default. If you want to build them, type 'make utils'. I will
  recommend to give a try if you are interested in color management. 
  tifficc can do wonderful things like converting CMYK separations
  to displayable files and other interesting stuff. Run the executable
  without parameters to see how it works.


  Removing //-C++ style comments
  ==============================

  There is a utility on root called 'filter.c' If your compiler
  doesn't support C++-style comments, apply this filter to all
  source & headers. Probably you would need to make your own 
  compilation script too. I will love! to know any exotic environment
  using lcms, so please me know if it worked.
