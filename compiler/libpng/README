These are libpng's sources. They are taken from libpng-1.0.10.tar.gz
available at http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

This file (README) and mmakefile.src are not part of the original
libpng distribution, but are added by hkiel@aros.org in order to
build this library under AROS.

Note that this is not the complete distribution of libpng, but a
stripped down version, which only contains the (generic, ie.
non-assembler) library's sources and the LICENSE.  For a complete
version check the above link.
