    This is just a dummy header to stay compatible with
    picture.datatype V43 .

    The real stuff is in <datatypes/pictureclass.h> .
    As it is in AmigaOS 3.5 .

    Is it a good idea to use capital letters in the filename?
    But this wasn't my idea. Blame the original author of
    picture.datatype V43 !
