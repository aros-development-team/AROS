 ***************************** GadgetClass ****************************
 **********************************************************************/

/* GadgetClass is the topmost class for all other gadget classes. In the
   current implementation it subclasses RootClass directly, but this may change
   in the future.

   GadgetClass does not perform any rendering or input handling itself, its
   subclasses are responsible for doing that. The only thing GadgetClass does,
   is preparing the structure Gadget (see <intuition/intuition.h>), which is
   supplied as immediate data at the address, the object pointer points to. In
   other words, objects of GadgetClass are struct Gadget pointers. */

/* *************************** Attributes *****************************/

/* Most subclasses of GadgetClass implement a subset of these attributes. Note
   also that even if an attribute is signed as settable, some subclasses may
   ignore this or even behave strange, if such an attribute is set, after they
   were added to a window. Read the class documentation of the subclasses to
   learn about such caveats.

   Many of these attributes correspond directly to a field of the Gadget
   structure or to one flag for this structure. See <intuition/intuition.h> for
   more information. */
