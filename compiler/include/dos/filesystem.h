/* Filesystem handlers are called with so-called actions whenever they are
   supposed to do something. See below for a list of currently defined actions
   and how to use them.

   Not all filesystems have to support all actions. Filesystems have to return
   ERROR_ACTION_NOT_KNOWN (<dos/dos.h>) in IOFileSys->io_DosError, if they do
   not support the specified action. If they know an action but ignore it on
   purpose, they may return ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED. A reason may be that the
   hardware or software the filesystem relies on does not support this kind of
   action (e.g. a net-filesystem protocol may not support renaming of files, so
   a filesystem handler for this protocol should return ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
   for FSA_RENAME). Another example is the nil-device, which does not implement
   FSA_CREATE_DIR or anything concerning specific files. What does that mean
   for an application? If an application receives ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, it
   knows that the action it wanted to perform makes no sense for that
   filesystem. If it receives ERROR_ACTION_NOT_KNOWN, it knows that the
   filesystem does not know about this action for whatever reason (including
   that it makes no sense to perform that action on that specific filesystem).

   All actions work relative to the current directory (where it makes sense),
   set in the IOFileSys->IOFS.io_Unit field. This field also serves as a
   pointer to filehandles for actions that either need a filehandle as argument
   or return one. When not explicitly stated otherwise this field has to be set
   to the filehandle to affect or is set to the filehandle that is returned by
   the action. Note that the filehandle mentioned above is not a pointer to a
   struct FileHandle as defined in <dos/dosextens.h>, but is an APTR to a
   device-specific blackbox structure. In a struct FileHandle this private
   pointer is normally to be found in FileHandle->fh_Unit.

   Whenever a filename is required as argument, this filename has to be
   stripped from the devicename, i.e. it has to be relative to the current
   directory on that volume (set in the io_Unit field). */
