/*  FUNCTION
        Given a list of ordered circular sublists, merge pairs of ordered sublists into one
	ordered circular sublist. 

    INPUTS
        l       - The first node of the first sublist. The sublists must be linked one
                  after the other one, and must be circular lists, that is their
		  first node's Pred pointer must point to their last node.
		  
		  I.e., the 2nd sublist will be at l->mln_Pred->mln_Succ, the 3rd will be at
		  l->mln_Pred->mln_Succ->mln_Pred->mln_Succ and so on.
		 
        compare - Pointer to the comparison function used to merge the 
                  sublists
		 
        data    - Pointer to user-defined data which will be passed untouched
                  to the comparison function.

    RESULT
        Pointer to the first node of the resulting list of sublists, with the same
	format of the input list, but with pairs of sublists merged into one.

           1) we first go trough the list once, making every node's Pred pointer
	      point to the node itself, so that the given list of n nodes is
	      transformed in a list of n circular sublists. Here we do the merging
	      "manually", without the help of the Merge() function, as we have to
	      deal with just couples of nodes, thus we can do some extra optimization.
	      
	   2) We then feed the resulting list to the Merge() function, as many times as
	      it takes to the Merge() function to give back just one circular list, rather
	      than a list of circular sublists: that will be our sorted list. */

	   in either case, the below line is necessary, because:
	   
	       1) In the first case, it serves to build the
