  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  This sample library intends to make Amiga shared library sources
  compileable with any available Amiga C compiler - without any
  changes to the source code.
  And maybe in the future also running under any Amiga compatible
  operating system with any CPU.

  The first goal seams to be easily done: nearly any noticeable compiler
  for the Amiga does support generation of libraries by special
  linker commands and pre-generated object files.

  But when looking into the details, one will find out, that these
  linker functionality just reduces the influence of the programmer
  on how his sources are handled, that the pre-generated object
  files just originally were done in Assembler, and that each compiler
  does define its own interface definitions and usage rules.

  But as a programmer, it is important to have control over the _complete_
  source code and to be able to compile it _anywhere_ with only
  minor changes, even better without any changes.

  Since most Amiga system modules - noticeable Libraries, Devices and
  Resources - do have startup-modules and other larger parts completely
  written in Assembler language, the most important task for getting
  inter-compiler and operating system independant sources in my opinion
  is, to completely migrate the interfaces to C language (but different
  to AROS, for example, it is most important, to keep the sources running
  under the current 68k AmigaOS in the _first_ place).

  This goal basically has been reached already, still missing of
  course are some of the less Amiga-native compilers and of course
  tests with any kind of "AmigaOS for PowerPC".

  But since Assembler is nearly as portability-hostile as BCPL _today_
  we may come quite close to the goal defined above by just moving
  towards C.

  Translate your 68k-assembler library startup-codes smartly
  to C by simply using this source-code as an advice how to do it.

  For testing: install the (re)compiled example.library to LIBS: and
  start the test program - it should pop up a requester, then.

  If you can submit adjustments for the other compilers as mentioned
  above: feel free to send these.

 Known Bugs:        - some versions of DOpus and all Installer versions
                      can't fetch the version information from the
                      library binary due to some bugs in their code.
                      Newer DOpus versions have this fixed and C:Version
                      for example did that task always.


 History:

 V37.15 (16.8.97) : - merged AmigaOS and AROS version
                      (-> Aaron Digulla, Andreas R. Kleinert)
                    - updated email addresses
                    - etc.

 V37.14 (13.8.97) : - AROS: - the LH1_ to LH2_ macro replacements in
                              "compiler.h" had been wrongly defined
                            - "BPTR" type only was available under AROS,
                              now using "struct SegList *"
                            - AROS version now does compile under AmigaOS
                              with SAS/C 6.58, too
                    - "APTR seglist" now "struct SegList *"

 V37.13 (19.7.97) : - GNU makefile had lost its TABs
                      (-> Gunter Nikl)

 V37.12 (29.6.97) : - fixed memory bug-fix (argh)
                      (-> Gunter Nikl)
                    - changed/applied GCC adjustments
                      (-> diffs by Gunter Nikl)

 V37.11 (24.6.97) : - added "known bugs" section
                    - LibInit now delocates library base on error
                      (NULL return)
                      (-> Gunter Nikl)
                    - added AROS version, and created an additional
                      source tree for it, since I did not get it compiled
                      with SAS/C 6.57 and there's perhaps additional
                      #ifdef stuf to be done. Anyone likes to merge these ?
                      (-> Aaron Digulla)

 V37.10 (6.4.97) :  - added GCC version by Stefan Fuchs, snfuchs@sokrates.franken.de.
                      Thanks !
                    - some small changes to docs, includes and comments
                    - still missing: DICE, Aztec, vbcc. Who does it ?
                    - fixed ftn email address

 V37.6 (27.3.97) :  - finetuning

 V37.5 (24.1.97) :  - rewrote docs
                    - added basic support for compiler independent
                      register naming and SAS/C keyword replacements
                      (compiler.h). Thus sources now should be easily
                      adaptable for GCC as well.

 V37.4 (8.1.97) :   - added FD file
                    - added new pragma file (and dir) as
                      include/pragma/example_lib.h
                      which works with Aztec, Maxon, Storm,
                      DICE and SAS C compilers.
                      Thanks to fd2pragma and Dirk Stoecker.
                    - some fixes to the readme files
                    - updated eMail list

 V37.3 (3.1.97) :   - slightly changed SCOPTIONS
                    - fixed some style things (APTR and library casts)
                    - changed note about library opening at L_OpenLibs()
                    - now compileable with StormC 2.0 as well
                      (not tested with 1.1) - see readme file for StormC
                    - added project file for StormC 2.0, smakefile still
                      present - select, which one you'd like to use

 V37.2 (12.12.96) : - applied some more changes and fixes
                      (-> suggested by Helmut Hummel)
                    - added icons
                      (-> from Helmut Hummel)

 V37.1 (4.12.96) : - bumped version to V37
                   - added MaxonC 3.x version by applying changes
                     to the SAS/C sources and adding Maxon
                     specific make and configuration files
                     (-> all done by Helmut Hummel, see Readme.MAXON)
                   - added StormC support
                   - yet missing: DICE, Aztec, GNU. Who does it ?

 V1.4 (30.11.96) : - added SAS/C specific Ctrl-C disabling code
                   - made some workarounds compiler sensitive
                   - redone all with SAS/C V6.57
                   - 944 Bytes ;-)

 V1.3 (13.9.96) :  - when starting lib as executable, -1 must be returned
                   - now caching SysBase
                   - added some comments, where changes should not
                     be applied
                   - added note about sharing library bases
                   - documented and modified sample function,
                     so that correct a0/a1/d0/d1 and a6 usage becomes
                     more obviously and verbose
                   - still 940 bytes ;-)

 V1.2 (5.9.96)  :  - fixed some things resulting out of a
                     discussion in Z-Netz

 V1.1 (1.9.96)  :  - small changes in style
                     (only bumped versions of changed modules):
                       o moved "examplebase.h" to include/example/
                         (so also adjusted LibInit.c, StartUp.c
                          and SCOPTIONS for reflecting that)
                       o SampleFuncs.h did contain wrong prototype
                         (did not matter, since only used for
                          ULONG function table within StartUp.c)
                       o explicitely __aligned ROMTag structure

 V1.0 (14.8.96) : - first release
