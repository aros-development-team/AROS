/*
 * random.c:
 * An improved random number generation package.  In addition to the standard
 * rand()/srand() like interface, this package also has a special state info
 * interface.  The initstate() routine is called with a seed, an array of
 * bytes, and a count of how many bytes are being passed in; this array is then
 * initialized to contain information for random number generation with that
 * much state information.  Good sizes for the amount of state information are
 * 32, 64, 128, and 256 bytes.  The state can be switched by calling the
 * setstate() routine with the same array as was initiallized with initstate().
 * By default, the package runs with 128 bytes of state information and
 * generates far better random numbers than a linear congruential generator.
 * If the amount of state information is less than 32 bytes, a simple linear
 * congruential R.N.G. is used.
 * Internally, the state information is treated as an array of longs; the
 * zeroeth element of the array is the type of R.N.G. being used (small
 * integer); the remainder of the array is the state information for the
 * R.N.G.  Thus, 32 bytes of state information will give 7 longs worth of
 * state information, which will allow a degree seven polynomial.  (Note: the 
 * zeroeth word of state information also has some other information stored
 * in it -- see setstate() for details).
 * The random number generation technique is a linear feedback shift register
 * approach, employing trinomials (since there are fewer terms to sum up that
 * way).  In this approach, the least significant bit of all the numbers in
 * the state table will act as a linear feedback shift register, and will have
 * period 2^deg - 1 (where deg is the degree of the polynomial being used,
 * assuming that the polynomial is irreducible and primitive).  The higher
 * order bits will have longer periods, since their values are also influenced
 * by pseudo-random carries out of the lower bits.  The total period of the
 * generator is approximately deg*(2**deg - 1); thus doubling the amount of
 * state information has a vast influence on the period of the generator.
 * Note: the deg*(2**deg - 1) is an approximation only good for large deg,
 * when the period of the shift register is the dominant factor.  With deg
 * equal to seven, the period is actually much longer than the 7*(2**7 - 1)
 * predicted by this formula.
 */

/*
 * For each of the currently supported random number generators, we have a
 * break value on the amount of state information (you need at least this
 * many bytes of state info to support this random number generator), a degree
 * for the polynomial (actually a trinomial) that the R.N.G. is based on, and
 * the separation between the two lower order coefficients of the trinomial.
