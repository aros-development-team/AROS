The root directory of AROS contains this:

AFD-COPYRIGHT - AROS' copyright message

BUGS - Known bugs of AROS

INSTALL - A short description on how to compile AROS the first time

INSTALL.amiga - A short description on how to compile AROS on Amiga

README - A readme with a short introduction about AROS

apps/ - This directory contains the source for applications for AROS.
	Applications are programs and packages which are not in the basic
	installation which is in \filename{workbench/}.

arosshell.c - The main code for the shell which allows you to execute AROS
	commands as you are used to it on your beloved Amiga. Also a very
	small demo of how it works and also probably the smallest demo
	that does something useful.

bin/ - This directory contains all generated files under the name of
	your OS (eg. \filename{AROS/bin/linux/}). This directory is called
	\shell{$(ARCHDIR)}. Below this are two more directories:
	\shell{$(BINDIR)} where the files should be put which the end user
	should see and \shell{$(GENDIR)} where you can create a directory
	to put all files one part of AROS needs (eg. \filename{libs/} or
	\filename{os/}). The directory \shell{$(OSGENDIR)} is below
	\shell{$(GENDIR)} and all \filename{*.o} files in this directory
	are collected to the \filename{AmigaOS.lib}.

compiler/ - The C compiler for AROS. It contains include files,
	the source for amiga.lib and c.lib and the source for the
	compiler and all compiler specific utilities.

config/ - This directory contains the dirty stuff. Code which makes AROS
	live (mostly hacked up assembler code which you don't want to see).
	Anything is allowed inside this directory in order to make AROS
	work on as many hardwares as possible.

configure - This is a small script which examines your system and
	creates a file named \filename{AROS/config/host.cfg} which is used by
	the makefiles.

crypt.c - This is a small program which allows you to create a password if
	you want to use the CVS server (prefered). See the section about
	\lref{CVS}{CVS} for how it works.

dist/ - \shell{make dist} will put an archive with all files for
	developers and users in this directory. Make sure the version in
	make.cfg is set to the correct value because it will be used to
	determine the name of the archive.

docs/ - The source and the formatted docs (currently only in HTML
	format).

local/ - This directory and it's contents are ignored by AROS. You can
	put alpha stuff here if you want to avoid CVS complaining about
	it.

mmakefile - This is the magic file which holds the whole thing together.
	It has the following rules:

	\filtermakefile{$(TOP)/mmakefile,target}

make.defaults - File with options for the make. If you want to change
	an option, create a file \filename{make.opts} and put your changes
	there. The most simple method is just to copy \filename{make.defaults}
	to \filename{make.opts}.

rom/ - Things which are internal parts of the OS.

scripts/ - Scripts which are used to generate code.

autogen.sh - Execute this shell-script to prepare for compilation of AROS.
	It checks for needed tools and tries to build them.
	Run it when you have installed a completely new tree or sources
	in the \filename{tools/} directory have changed.
	This script also generates and runs \filename{configure} from
	\filename{configure.in}.

tools/ - This contains build tools.

test/ - Testcode, which is more complex.

tpl.c - Template file for AROS system library functions. Each function
	gets it's own file.

workbench/ - The disk-based part of AROS.
