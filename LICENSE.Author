This file contains additional license permissions, as granted
by individual authors for their AROS changesets.

PLEASE NOTE: These licenses DO NOT REPLACE the license of the
portions of AROS that they have contributed to. They merely
allow the use of their changesets in other projects, under the
specified license(s).

Be aware that this file only covers changesets!

If more that one Author has changes present in a file that
you plan to use in another project, only the lines that are
from changesets that are permitted to be relicensed may be
relicensed for use in another project.
