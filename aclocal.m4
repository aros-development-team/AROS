# AM_PATH_PYTHON([MINIMUM-VERSION], [ACTION-IF-FOUND], [ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND])

# Adds support for distributing Python modules and packages.  To
# install modules, copy them to $(pythondir), using the python_PYTHON
# automake variable.  To install a package with the same name as the
# automake package, install to $(pkgpythondir), or use the
# pkgpython_PYTHON automake variable.

# The variables $(pyexecdir) and $(pkgpyexecdir) are provided as
# locations to install python extension modules (shared libraries).
# Another macro is required to find the appropriate flags to compile
# extension modules.

# If your package is configured with a different prefix to python,
# users will have to add the install directory to the PYTHONPATH
# environment variable, or create a .pth file (see the python
# documentation for details).

# If the MINIMUM-VERSION argument is passed, AM_PATH_PYTHON will
# cause an error if the version of python installed on the system
# doesn't meet the requirement.  MINIMUM-VERSION should consist of
# numbers and dots only.
