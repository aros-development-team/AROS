/*
 * User-mode part of exception handling. Save context, call
 * exec handler, then resume task.
 * Note that interrupts are disabled and SysBase->IDNestCnt contains 0
 * upon entry. Real IDNestCnt count for the task is stored in its tc_IDNestCnt.
 *
 * We have to do this complex trick with disabling interrupts because
 * in Windows exception handler operates on thread's stack, this means
 * we can't modify the stack inside exception handler, i.e. we can't save
 * the context on task's stack.
 *
 * In order to overcome this we forcibly disable interrupts in core_Dispatch()
 * and make the task to jump here. After this et_RegFrame still contains
 * unmodified saved task context. Since we're running normally on our stack,
 * we can save the context on the stack here.
 * Inside Exception() interrupts and task switching will be enabled, so original
 * IDNestCnt will be lost. In order to prevent it we save it on the stack too.
 *
 * When we're done we pick up saved IDNestCnt from stack and raise
 * AROS_EXCEPTION_RESUME in order to jump back to the saved context.
