=============================================================================
1. Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document describes arosboot, the program used to load and install
AROS modules on the Native Amiga.


=============================================================================
2. Requirements
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arosboot requires a 68020 or better processor and Kickstart V37 (Release 2.04)
or better.


=============================================================================
3. Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have unpacked the archive, you will have a directory "AROS" where
everything you need can be found.

  AROS/
  AROS/arosboot
  AROS/arosboot.config
  AROS/os/               <== main AROS modules live here
  AROS/tools/            <== various utilities

CD into this directory and you're ready to run "arosboot".


=============================================================================
4. Usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

arosboot CONFIGFILE,CHIP/S,FAST/S,KICK/S,LOCAL/S,CLEAR/S,CO=CLEARONLY/S,
         RESET/S,DEBUG/S,SIM=SIMULATE/S,FORCE/S,QUIET/S

  Configfile

    Config file to use, default is "arosboot.config".

  Chip/Fast/Kick/Local

    Force the modules to a particular type of memory. If your original
    Kickstart is V37 (Release 2), the default is chip memory. If you have
    fast memory on your motherboard, you can specify the option "fast" to
    force the modules to that fastmem. On Kickstart V39/V40 (Release 3/3.1)
    the default is "kick" memory. If you specify more than one memory
    type, the order of precedence is kick->local->fast->chip.

  Clear

    Clear the reset vectors before installing new modules. Use this if you
    have already loaded AROS and want to load new modules, or else there will
    be 2 copies of AROS modules in memory.

  Clearonly  : only clear reset vectors and exit

    Only clear the reset vectors and exit. Use this so AROS will not come up
    during the next reset. Use it together with the reset option to reset the
    machine right now.

  Reset

    After arosboot has installed modules, the computer has to be reset to
    activate these modules. You can do that by hand or use this option to let
    arosboot reset the machine by itself. There will be a 2 second delay to
    give diskaccess a chance to finish.

  Debug

    Output debugging information. Include this debug output in a bug report,
    if you suspect there are problems with arosboot. This setting will
    override the quiet setting.

  Simulate

    Simulate loading, do not actually install modules. This will read the
    config file and load the modules into memory, but will immediately
    unload them. You can use this to test your installation.

  Force

    Normally, arosboot will not install modules if it finds that AROS modules
    have already been installed in the system. Use force to override this so
    new modules will be loaded. Don't forget to specify "clear" to delete the
    old modules from memory.

  Quiet

    Be quiet.


All file operations (reading the config file and loading the modules) will be
done relative to the directory where arosboot itself is located. This means
you don't have to CD into arosboot's directory but can just run arosboot from
anywhere and it will behave as if you CD'd into it's directory yourself.


=============================================================================
5. Config File Usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example config file:

----8<----8<----
  ;
  ; arosboot config file
  ;
  ;
  MODULE os/exec.strap
  MODULE os/alert.hook
  MODULE os/utility.library
  ;
  FUNCTION -72	os/exec.strap	ON	; InitCode
  FUNCTION -84	os/exec.strap	ON	; MakeLibrary
  FUNCTION -90	os/exec.strap	OFF	; MakeFunctions
----8<----8<----

MODULE lines

  Template: MODULE/K/A

  These lines contain the names (including (relative) paths) of the modules
  to install.

  The MODULE keyword is compulsory.

FUNCTION lines

  Template: FUNCTION/N/K/A,MODULE/A,ON/S,OFF/S

  With these lines you can specify which functions in a module should be
  turned on or off. Currently this is only possible for the "exec.strap"
  module. If you turn a function off, the original AmigaOS function will
  be used instead. You can use this to selectively disable certain functions,
  to aid in debugging and more specific bug reports.

  The FUNCTION keyword is compulsory. The MODULE keyword can be omitted.
  Both arguments must be specified.

  If you don't specify ON or OFF, the function will be turned on. If you
  specify both ON and OFF, the function will be turned on.

  Be very careful if you disable functions. Many functions are part of a
  constructor/deconstructor pair. E.g. if you disable AllocVec, you also
  _must_ disable FreeVec. Experience with the AmigaOS API is recommended
  before you start turning functions on/off. If you are unsure about
  something, you can always ask for our help.

COMMENTS

  Start comment lines with a ; character.


=============================================================================
6. Technical Information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

68020+ version
--------------
There is no 68000 version at the moment, because AROS itself is only compiled
for 68020 or better processors. This way you can never inadvertently install
AROS modules on systems with a 68000/68010. 68000 support will be added in the
future.

arosboot and memory
-------------------
AROS modules are loaded into RAM. The memory they are loaded in has to be
available very early during the reboot. This limits the types of memory that
can be used. On Kickstart V39 and above, exec recognizes all memory available
for this process by marking it with a special flag, the "kickmemory" flag. On
this Kickstart, arosboot will load memory into this kickmemory by default.

On Kickstart V37, the exec doesn't have this flag, so arosboot has to guess
which memory it can use for the modules. Chip memory is one region of memory
that is guaranteed to always be available early in the reset procedure.
Arosboot uses chipmemory by default on this Kickstart version. Fast memory
on expansion cards is not guaranteed to be available early in the reset
procedure, but fast memory on the motherboard generally is. If you have fast
memory on your motherboard you can force AROS modules to be loaded into
this fast memory by specifying the "fast" option. If you have fast memory on
both the motherboard and expansion cards, you can try the "local" flag. This
will load the modules in "local" memory, which is generally the fast memory
on the motherboard, and the chip memory, with a preference for fast memory.

arosboot and system patches
---------------------------
If you use system patches like FastExec, MCP, SystemPrefs, or similar, you
may find that there are problems with installation of AROS modules. Such
utilities can move certain system structures to fast memory, but they will
only do that after the system is up and running. AROS modules will be started
very early in the reset procedure, before these utilities have had a chance to
perform their memory swizzling. If such a utility relocates some system
structure to fast memory, and the OS can't find that structure during the
reset, it will construct a new structure. If this happens, all resetproof
programs, such as AROS modules, will be purged from memory. More specifically,
a new execbase structure will be built, which has empty reset vectors, so
resetproof modules will be forgotten.

If you experience problems (such as AROS disappearing during a reset), try
turning off options that relocate certain things to fast memory. Examples of
this are: SSP to fastmem, Exec to fastmem, Expansion to fastmem, Interrupts
to fastmem, etc. Try turning all of these off, and if AROS works, turn them
on one at a time to see which option is incompatible with AROS.

arosboot utilities
------------------
Two utilities are included with arosboot:

Showvecs shows a report of everything that lives at the system reset vectors
used by arosboot. If the checksum of these vectors is correct, an extended
report is printed, else only the vectors themselves are printed. If arosboot
is successful, you can see the new contents of the vectors even before a
reset.

Printresmodules shows all Resident Modules that are currently in the System
Resident Module List. Newly loaded AROS modules will only show up in this list
after a system reset. To find AROS modules, look for modules that are in RAM
(they have an address outside of the $f80000-$ffffff range), and the
"arosboot.cookie" module at priority -120.

9. History
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

41.8
- Fixed bug that could cause reset vector corruption (mementry for the
  KickTagPtr was 4 bytes short).

41.7
- Do all file operations relative to PROGDIR:. This applies to the config
  file itself as well as to modules. This removes the need to CD into the
  directory where arosboot lives before running arosboot.

41.6
- Major overhaul.
- New command line options.
- Extended config file format.
- Renamed to "arosboot".
- Docs.

41.5
- Back out 41.4 change of falling back to MEMF_LOCAL. It turned out to worsen
  the situation when using FastExec with the "local" option. Still have the
  "-l" option in boot to force AROS to MEMF_LOCAL.

41.4
- No longer fall back to MEMF_CHIP on kick V37, but to MEMF_LOCAL. This
  may also benefit FastExec users.

41.3
- First public release.
- Fail if option not recognized (e.g. "boot 0x" instead of "boot -x").
