TODO list for the Palm Port (ROM)

- Rename CREATE_ROM define in all files where used to AROS_CREATE_ROM

- When processes are closed access to DOSBase (see createnewproc ->
  KillCurrentProcess()) is needed. Since DOSBase cannot be a global 
  variable the DOSBase must either be found on the stack (needs to be 
  put on the stack when the process/task is created) or one must use
  OpenLibrary() [tried it w/o much success]

- adapting towards i386-native version:
  - all modules should be searched for in the ROM and their information
    about their resident lists should be collected into a list
  - Task switching should be done like in i386 native (same functions etc.)

- IRQ Hidd
- graphics hidd (black and white support might be difficult to achieve with
  our multi color OS, might want to try a 256/64k color display hidd)
- rom handler for file system: needed to place AROS files on it and to be
  able to boot something.
