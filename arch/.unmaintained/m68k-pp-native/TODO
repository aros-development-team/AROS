TODO list for the Palm Port (ROM)

- The memory allocation for the Supervisor stack, display memory is
  a mess right now or non-existent.
   -> Allocate memory for SSP in exec_init.c via AllocMem()
   

- When processes are closed access to DOSBase (see createnewproc ->
  KillCurrentProcess()) is needed. Since DOSBase cannot be a global 
  variable the DOSBase must either be found on the stack (needs to be 
  put on the stack when the process/task is created) or one must use
  OpenLibrary() [tried it w/o much success]

- adapting towards i386-native version:
  - all modules should be searched for in the ROM and their information
    about their resident lists should be collected into a list
    (see i386 native version of exec_init.c)
  - Task switching should be done like in i386 native (same functions etc.)

     Function  |  like i386 version
   ------------+--------------------
   Disable     |  yes
   Enable      |  yes
   AddTask     |  no -> needs Reschedule()
   RemTask     |  no -> Copy from i386 version 
   Switch      |  there's no need for this function in i386
   Signal      |  no -> copy i386 version!
   Supervisor  |  yes
   Superstate  |  yes (untested, could be made simpler)
   Userstate   |  yes (untested, could be made simpler)
   Reschedule  |  no (copy from i386 and change asm code)
   SetExcept   |  no (copy from i386)
   Dispatch    |  no (not needed in i386 version)
   Wait        |  no (copy from i386)
   SetTaskPri  |  no (copy from i386)


- IRQ Hidd
- graphics hidd (black and white support might be difficult to achieve with
  our multi color OS, might want to try a 256/64k color display hidd)
- rom handler for file system: needed to place AROS files on it and to be
  able to boot something.
