To get AROS/Palm to run under POSE, a few changes need to
be done to the POSE Source. So here's what you need to
do (POSE 3.4):

Emulator_Src_3.4/SrcShared/EmStructs.h:

 In the IsValid() function comment out the following
 check
 
    if (!fDevice.SupportsROM (fROMFile))
    	return false;
 
 This is necessary, because otherwise it does not accept
 the AROS ROM.
 

Emulator_Src_3.4/SrcShared/Hardware/EmBankDRAM.cpp:

 #if 0 out everthing in the PrvCheckBelowStackPointerAccess()
 function, otherwise stack errors are reported all the time.
 

Emulator_Src_3.4/SrcShared/EmPalmOS.cpp:

 In the function EmPalmOS::CheckStackPointerDecrement()
 comment out the "Errors::ReportErrStackOverflow ();"
 inside the "if(fatal)" block, otherwise one gets
 stack overflow errors.
