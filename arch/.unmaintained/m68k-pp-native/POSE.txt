To get AROS/Palm to run under POSE, a few changes need to
be done to the POSE Source. So here's what you need to
do (POSE 3.4):

Emulator_Src_3.4/SrcShared/EmStructs.h:

 In the IsValid() function comment out the following
 check
 
    if (!fDevice.SupportsROM (fROMFile))
    	return false;
 
 This is necessary, because otherwise it does not accept
 the AROS ROM.


ONe change is necessary to the AROS source code:

config/m68k-pp-native/exec/rawputchar.c
Deactivate the line where the address 0xdddddebc is accessed.
