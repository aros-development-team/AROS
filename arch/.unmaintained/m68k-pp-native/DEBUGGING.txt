It's possible to get debug output done by AROS through
D(bug("")) (kprintf) out of the Palm Emulation into the
Linux Shell by doing this:

1. Compile AROS/Palm using this configure option:

   ./configure --target=pp-m68k --enable-palm-debug-hack
   
   This will make AROS' exec/RawPutChar() simply poke the
   debug char into address 0xdddddebc.
   
2. Use a special version of XCopilot which turns byte writes
   to address 0xdddddebc into output going into the Linux
   shell.
   
   All you need to do is get the source of XCopilot 0.6.6 and
   replace the file "mc68k/memory.c" with "xcopilotpatch/memory.c"
   before compiling XCopilot.
