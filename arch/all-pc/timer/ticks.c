/*
 * This code uses two channels of the PIT for simplicity:
 * Channel 0 - sends IRQ 0 on terminal count. We use it as alarm clock.
 * Channel 2 is used as EClock counter. It counts all the time and is never reloaded.
 *	     We initialize it in timer_init.c.
 */

/*
 * The math magic behing this is:
 *
 * 1. Theoretical value of microseconds is: tick * 1000000 / tb_eclock_rate.
 * 2. tb_eclock_rate is constant and equal to 1193180Hz (frequency of PIT's master quartz).
 * 3. tick2usec() is called much more frequently than usec2tick(). And multiplication is faster than division.
 *
 * So let's get rid of division:
 *
 * a) Multiply both divident and divisor of the initial equation by 0x100000000 (4294967296 in decimal). In asm this
 *    can be accomplished simply by using 64-bit math ops and using upper half instead of lower:
 *    usec = (tick * 1000000 * 0x100000000) / (1193180 * 0x100000000) = tick * (1000000 * 0x100000000 / 1193180) / 0x100000000.
 * b) Calculate the constant part in brackets: 1000000 * 4294967296 / 1193180 = 3599597124.
 * c) So: usec = tick * 3599597124 / 0x100000000 = (tick * 3599597124) >> 32.
