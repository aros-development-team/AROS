GRUB team is aware of following problems:
  - Currently search and assembling multidevice abstractions scans
    all the devices which can be slow.
  - Cache isn't used correctly for video which results in slowness.

While these are bugs their solution has a potential of breaking more and more
seriously. So it was decided for 1.99 that they aren't fixed.
