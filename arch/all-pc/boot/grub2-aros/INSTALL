This is the GRUB.  Welcome.

This file contains instructions for compiling and installing the GRUB.

The Requirements
================

GRUB depends on some software packages installed into your system. If
you don't have any of them, please obtain and install them before
configuring the GRUB.

* GCC 4.1.3 or later
  Note: older versions may work but support is limited
  Note: clang 3.2 or later works for i386 and x86_64 targets but results in
        much bigger binaries.
	earlier versions not tested
  Note: clang 3.2 or later works for arm
	None of tested clang versions generated usable thumb code
	earlier versions not tested
  Note: clang 3.3 or later works for arm64
	earlier versions have no arm64 support
  Note: clang 3.3 or later works for mips(el)
	earlier versions fail to generate .reginfo and hence gprel relocations
	fail.
  Note: clang 3.2 or later works for powerpc
	earlier versions not tested
  Note: clang doesn't support -mno-app-regs and so can't be used for sparc64
  Note: clang has no support for ia64 and hence you can't compile GRUB
	for ia64 with clang
* GNU Make
* GNU Bison 2.3 or later
* GNU gettext 0.17 or later
* GNU binutils 2.9.1.0.23 or later
* Flex 2.5.35 or later
* Other standard GNU/Unix tools
* a libc with large file support (e.g. glibc 2.1 or later)

On GNU/Linux, you also need:

* libdevmapper 1.02.34 or later (recommended)

For optional grub-emu features, you need:

* SDL (recommended)
* libpciaccess (optional)
* libusb (optional)

To build GRUB's graphical terminal (gfxterm), you need:

* FreeType 2 or later
* GNU Unifont

If you use a development snapshot or want to hack on GRUB you may
need the following.

* Python 2.6 or later
* Autoconf 2.60 or later
* Automake 1.10.1 or later

Prerequisites for make-check:

* qemu, specifically the binary 'qemu-system-i386'
* xorriso 1.2.9 or later, for grub-mkrescue and grub-shell

Configuring the GRUB
====================

The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a
file `config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try to
figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

The file `configure.ac' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.


Building the GRUB
=================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code.

  2. Skip this and following step if you use release tarball and proceed to
     step 4. If you want translations type `./linguas.sh'.
  
  3. Type `./autogen.sh'.

  4. Type `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
     If you're using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might
     need to type `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying
     to execute `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  6. Type `make' to compile the package.

  7. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  8. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  9. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Cross-compiling the GRUB
========================

GRUB defines 3 platforms:

  - "Build" is the one which build systems runs on.
  - "Host" is where you execute GRUB utils.
  - "Target" is where GRUB itself runs.

For grub-emu host and target must be the same but may differ from build.

If build and host are different make check isn't available.

If build and host are different man pages are not generated.

As an example imagine you have a build system running on FreeBSD on sparc
which prepares packages for developers running amd64 GNU/Linux laptop and
they need to make images for ARM board running U-boot. In this case:

build=sparc64-freebsd
host=amd64-linux-gnu
target=arm-uboot

For this example the configure line might look like (more details below)
(some options are optional and included here for completeness but some rarely
used options are omitted):

./configure BUILD_CC=gcc BUILD_FREETYPE=freetype-config --host=amd64-linux-gnu
CC=amd64-linux-gnu-gcc CFLAGS="-g -O2" FREETYPE=amd64-linux-gnu-freetype-config
--target=arm --with-platform=uboot TARGET_CC=arm-elf-gcc
TARGET_CFLAGS="-Os -march=armv6" TARGET_CCASFLAGS="-march=armv6"
TARGET_OBJCOPY="arm-elf-objcopy" TARGET_STRIP="arm-elf-strip"
TARGET_NM=arm-elf-nm TARGET_RANLIB=arm-elf-ranlib LEX=gflex

You need to use following options to specify tools and platforms. For minimum
version look at prerequisites. All tools not mentioned in this section under
corresponding platform are not needed for the platform in question.

  - For build
    1. BUILD_CC= to gcc able to compile for build. This is used, for
       example, to compile build-gentrigtables which is then run to
       generate sin and cos tables.
    2. BUILD_CFLAGS= for C options for build.
    3. BUILD_CPPFLAGS= for C preprocessor options for build.
    4. BUILD_LDFLAGS= for linker options for build.
    5. BUILD_FREETYPE= for freetype-config for build (optional).

  - For host
    1. --host= to autoconf name of host.
    2. CC= for gcc able to compile for host
    3. CFLAGS= for C options for host.
    4. CPPFLAGS= for C preprocessor options for host.
    5. LDFLAGS= for linker options for host.
    6. FREETYPE= for freetype-config for host (optional).
    7. Libdevmapper if any must be in standard linker folders (-ldevmapper) (optional).
    8. Libfuse if any must be in standard linker folders (-lfuse) (optional).
    9. Libzfs if any must be in standard linker folders (-lzfs) (optional).
    10. Liblzma if any must be in standard linker folders (-llzma) (optional).

  - For target
    1. --target= to autoconf cpu name of target.
    2. --with-platform to choose firmware.
    3. TARGET_CC= for gcc able to compile for target
    4. TARGET_CFLAGS= for C options for target.
    5. TARGET_CPPFLAGS= for C preprocessor options for target.
    6. TARGET_CCASFLAGS= for assembler options for target.
    7. TARGET_LDFLAGS= for linker options for target.
    8. TARGET_OBJCOPY= for objcopy for target.
    9. TARGET_STRIP= for strip for target.
    10. TARGET_NM= for nm for target.
    11. TARGET_RANLIB= for ranlib for target.

  - Additionally for emu, for host and target.
    1. SDL is looked for in standard linker directories (-lSDL) (optional)
    2. libpciaccess is looked for in standard linker directories (-lpciaccess) (optional)
    3. libusb is looked for in standard linker directories (-lusb) (optional)

  - Platform-agnostic tools and data.
    1. make is the tool you execute after ./configure.
    2. Bison is specified in YACC= variable
    3. Flex is specified in LEX= variable
    4. GNU unifont and Djvu sans are looked for in standard directories.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  `cd' to the directory where you want the object files
and executables to go and run the `configure' script.  `configure'
automatically checks for the source code in the directory that
`configure' is in and in `..'.


Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix by giving `configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.

You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If
you give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will
use PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for
particular kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the
directories you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure'
the option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Please note, however, that the GRUB knows where it is located in the
filesystem.  If you have installed it in an unusual location, the
system might not work properly, or at all.  The chief utility of these
options for the GRUB is to allow you to "install" in some alternate
location, and then copy these to the actual root filesystem later.


Sharing Defaults
================

If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.


Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.
