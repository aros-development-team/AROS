@node Coding style
@chapter Coding style
@c By YoshinoriOkuji, VesaJääskeläinen and ColinBennett

Basically we follow the @uref{http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html, GNU Coding Standards}. We define additional conventions for GRUB here.

* Functions::
* Variables::

@node Naming Conventions
@section Naming Conventions

All global symbols (i.e. functions, variables, types, and macros) must have the prefix grub_ or GRUB_. The all capital form is used only by macros.

@node Functions
@section Functions

If a function is global, its name must be prefixed with grub_ and must consist of only small letters. If the function belongs to a specific function module, the name must also be prefixed with the module name. For example, if a function is for file systems, its name is prefixed with grub_fs_. If a function is for FAT file system but not for all file systems, its name is prefixed with grub_fs_fat_. The hierarchy is noted this way.

After a prefix, a function name must start with a verb (such as get or is). It must not be a noun. Some kind of abbreviation is permitted, as long as it wouldn't make code less readable (e.g. init).

If a function is local, its name may not start with any prefix. It must start with a verb.

@node Variables
@section Variables

The rule is mostly the same as functions, as noted above. If a variable is global, its name must be prefixed with grub_ and must consist of only small letters. If the variable belongs to a specific function module, the name must also be prefixed with the module name. For example, if a function is for dynamic loading, its name is prefixed with grub_dl_. If a variable is for ELF but not for all dynamic loading systems, its name is prefixed with grub_dl_elf_.

After a prefix, a variable name must start with a noun or an adjective (such as name or long) and it should end with a noun. Some kind of abbreviation is permitted, as long as it wouldn't make code less readable (e.g. i18n).

If a variable is global in the scope of a single file (i.e. it is declared with static), its name may not start with any prefix. It must start with a noun or an adjective.

If a variable is local, you may choose any shorter name, as long as it wouldn't make code less readable (e.g. i).

@node Types
@section Types

The name of a type must be prefixed with grub_ and must consist of only small letters. If the type belongs to a specific function module, the name must also be prefixed with the module name. For example, if a type is for OS loaders, its name is prefixed with grub_loader_. If a type is for Multiboot but not for all OS loaders, its name is prefixed with grub_loader_linux_.

The name must be suffixed with _t, to emphasize the fact that it is a type but not a variable or a function.

@node Macros
@section Macros

If a macro is global, its name must be prefixed with GRUB_ and must consist of only large letters. Other rules are the same as functions or variables, depending on whether a macro is used like a function or a variable.

@node Comments
@section Comments

All comments shall be C-style comments, of the form @samp{/* @dots{} */}.

Comments shall be placed only on a line by themselves.  They shall not be placed together with code, variable declarations, or other non-comment entities.  A comment should be placed immediately preceding the entity it describes.

Acceptable:
@example
/* The page # that is the front buffer.  */
int displayed_page;
/* The page # that is the back buffer.  */
int render_page;
@end example

Unacceptable:
@example
int displayed_page;           /* The page # that is the front buffer. */
int render_page;              /* The page # that is the back buffer. */
@end example

@node Multi-Line Comments
@section Multi-Line Comments

Comments spanning multiple lines shall be formatted with all lines after the first aligned with the first line.  

Asterisk characters should not be repeated a the start of each subsequent line.

Acceptable:
@example
/* This is a comment
   which spans multiple lines.
   It is long.  */
@end example

Unacceptable:
@example
/*
 * This is a comment
 * which spans multiple lines.
 * It is long. */
@end example

The opening @samp{/*} and closing @samp{*/} should be placed together on a line with text.

@node Finding your way around
@chapter Finding your way around

Here is a brief map of the GRUB code base.

GRUB uses Autoconf and Automake, with most of the Automake input generated
by a Python script.  The top-level build rules are in @file{configure.ac},
@file{grub-core/Makefile.core.def}, and @file{Makefile.util.def}.  Each
block in a @file{*.def} file represents a build target, and specifies the
source files used to build it on various platforms.  The @file{*.def} files
are processed into Automake input by @file{gentpl.py} (which you only need
to look at if you are extending the build system).  If you are adding a new
module which follows an existing pattern, such as a new command or a new
filesystem implementation, it is usually easiest to grep
@file{grub-core/Makefile.core.def} and @file{Makefile.util.def} for an
existing example of that pattern to find out where it should be added.

In general, code that may be run at boot time is in a subdirectory of
@file{grub-core}, while code that is only run from within a full operating
system is in a subdirectory of the top level.

Low-level boot code, such as the MBR implementation on PC BIOS systems, is
in the @file{grub-core/boot/} directory.

The GRUB kernel is in @file{grub-core/kern/}.  This contains core facilities
such as the device, disk, and file frameworks, environment variable
handling, list processing, and so on.  The kernel should contain enough to
get up to a rescue prompt.  Header files for kernel facilities, among
others, are in @file{include/}.

Terminal implementations are in @file{grub-core/term/}.

Disk access code is spread across @file{grub-core/disk/} (for accessing the
disk devices themselves), @file{grub-core/partmap/} (for interpreting
partition table data), and @file{grub-core/fs/} (for accessing filesystems).
Note that, with the odd specialised exception, GRUB only contains code to
@emph{read} from filesystems and tries to avoid containing any code to
@emph{write} to filesystems; this lets us confidently assure users that GRUB
cannot be responsible for filesystem corruption.

PCI and USB bus handling is in @file{grub-core/bus/}.

Video handling code is in @file{grub-core/video/}.  The graphical menu
system uses this heavily, but is in a separate directory,
@file{grub-core/gfxmenu/}.

Most commands are implemented by files in @file{grub-core/commands/}, with
the following exceptions:

@itemize
@item
A few core commands live in @file{grub-core/kern/corecmd.c}.

@item
Commands related to normal mode live under @file{grub-core/normal/}.

@item
Commands that load and boot kernels live under @file{grub-core/loader/}.

@item
The @samp{loopback} command is really a disk device, and so lives in
@file{grub-core/disk/loopback.c}.

@item
The @samp{gettext} command lives under @file{grub-core/gettext/}.

@item
The @samp{loadfont} and @samp{lsfonts} commands live under
@file{grub-core/font/}.

@item
The @samp{serial}, @samp{terminfo}, and @samp{background_image} commands
live under @file{grub-core/term/}.

@item
The @samp{efiemu_*} commands live under @file{grub-core/efiemu/}.

@item
OS-dependent code should be under @file{grub-core/osdep/}

@item
Utility programs meant to be run from a full operating system
(except OS-dependent code mentioned previously) are in @file{util/}.

@end itemize

There are a few other special-purpose exceptions; grep for them if they
matter to you.

@node Contributing Changes
@chapter Contributing changes
@c By YoshinoriOkuji, VesaJääskeläinen, ColinWatson

Contributing changes to GRUB 2 is welcomed activity. However we have a
bit of control what kind of changes will be accepted to GRUB 2.
Therefore it is important to discuss your changes on grub-devel mailing list
(see MailingLists). On this page there are some basic details on the
development process and activities.

First of all you should come up with the idea yourself what you want to
contribute. If you do not have that beforehand you are advised to study this
manual and try GRUB 2 out to see what you think is missing from there.

Here are additional pointers:
@itemize
@item @url{https://savannah.gnu.org/task/?group=grub GRUB's Task Tracker}
@item @url{https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=grub GRUB's Bug Tracker}
@end itemize

If you intended to make changes to GRUB Legacy (<=0.97) those are not accepted
anymore.

@end menu

@node Getting started
@section Getting started

@itemize
@item Always use latest GRUB 2 source code. So get that first.

For developers it is recommended always to use the newest development version of GRUB 2. If development takes a long period of time, please remember to keep in sync with newest developments regularly so it is much easier to integrate your change in the future. GRUB 2 is being developed in a GIT repository.

Please check Savannah's GRUB project page for details how to get newest git:
@uref{https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=grub, GRUB 2 git Repository}

@item Compile it and try it out.

It is always good idea to first see that things work somehow and after that
to start to implement new features or develop fixes to bugs.

@item Study the code.

There are sometimes odd ways to do things in GRUB 2 code base.
This is mainly related to limited environment where GRUB 2 is being executed.
You usually do not need to understand it all so it is better to only try to
look at places that relates to your work. Please do not hesitate to ask for
help if there is something that you do not understand.

@item Develop a new feature.

Now that you know what to do and how it should work in GRUB 2 code base, please
be free to develop it. If you have not so far announced your idea on grub-devel
mailing list, please do it now. This is to make sure you are not wasting your
time working on the solution that will not be integrated to GRUB 2 code base.

You might want to study our coding style before starting development so you
do not need to change much of the code when your patch is being reviewed.
(see @ref{Coding style})

For every accepted patch there has to exist a ChangeLog entry. Our ChangeLog
consist of changes within source code and are not describing about what the
change logically does. Please see examples from previous entries.

Also remember that GRUB 2 is licensed under GPLv3 license and that usually
means that you are not allowed to copy pieces of code from other projects.
Even if the source project's license would be compatible with GPLv3, please
discuss it beforehand on grub-devel mailing list.

@item Test your change.

Test that your change works properly. Try it out a couple of times, preferably on different systems, and try to find problems with it.

@item Publish your change.

When you are happy with your change, first make sure it is compilable with
latest development version of GRUB 2. After that please send a patch to
grub-devel for review. Please describe in your email why you made the change,
what it changes and so on. Please be prepared to receive even discouraging
comments about your patch. There is usually at least something that needs
to be improved in every patch.

Please use unified diff to make your patch (good match of arguments for diff is @samp{-pruN}).

@item Respond to received feedback.

If you are asked to modify your patch, please do that and resubmit it for
review. If your change is large you are required to submit a copyright
agreement to FSF. Please keep in mind that if you are asked to submit
for copyright agreement, process can take some time and is mandatory
in order to get your changes integrated.

If you are not on grub-devel to respond to questions, most likely your patch
will not be accepted. Also if problems arise from your changes later on,
it would be preferable that you also fix the problem. So stay around
for a while.

@item Your patch is accepted.

Good job! Your patch will now be integrated into GRUB 2 mainline, and if it didn't break anything it will be publicly available in the next release.

Now you are welcome to do further improvements :)

@node Typical Developer Experience
@section Typical Developer Experience

The typical experience for a developer in this project is the following:

@enumerate
@item You find yourself wanting to do something (e.g. fixing a bug).
@item You show some result in the mailing list or the IRC.
@item You are getting to be known to other developers.
@item You accumulate significant amount of contribution, so copyright assignment is processed.
@item You are free to check in your changes on your own, legally speaking.
@end enumerate

At this point, it is rather annoying that you ought to ask somebody else every
change to be checked in. For efficiency, it is far better, if you can commit
it yourself. Therefore, our policy is to give you the write permission to our
official repository, once you have shown your skill and will,
and the FSF clerks have dealt with your copyright assignment.

@node When you are approved for write access to project's files
@section When you are approved for write access to project's files

As you might know, GRUB is hosted on
@url{https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/grub Savannah}, thus the membership
is managed by Savannah. This means that, if you want to be a member of this
project:

@enumerate
@item You need to create your own account on Savannah.
@item You can submit ``Request for Inclusion'' from ``My Groups'' on Savannah.
@end enumerate

Then, one of the admins can approve your request, and you will be a member.
If you don't want to use the Savannah interface to submit a request, you can
simply notify the admins by email or something else, alternatively. But you
still need to create an account beforehand.

NOTE: we sometimes receive a ``Request for Inclusion'' from an unknown person.
In this case, the request would be just discarded, since it is too dangerous
to allow a stranger to be a member, which automatically gives him a commit
right to the repository, both for a legal reason and for a technical reason. 

If your intention is to just get started, please do not submit a inclusion
request. Instead, please subscribe to the mailing list, and communicate first
(e.g. sending a patch, asking a question, commenting on another message...).

@node Porting
@chapter Porting

GRUB2 is designed to be easily portable accross platforms. But because of the
nature of bootloader every new port must be done separately. Here is how I did
MIPS (loongson and ARC) and Xen ports. Note than this is more of suggestions,
not absolute truth.

First of all grab any architecture specifications you can find in public
(please avoid NDA).

First stage is ``Hello world''. I've done it outside of GRUB for simplicity.
Your task is to have a small program which is loadable as bootloader and
clearly shows its presence to you. If you have easily accessible console
you can just print a message. If you have a mapped framebuffer you know address
of, you can draw a square. If you have a debug facility, just hanging without
crashing might be enough. For the first stage you can choose to load the
bootloader across the network since format for network image is often easier
than for local boot and it skips the need of small intermediary stages and
nvram handling. Additionally you can often have a good idea of the needed
format by running ``file'' on any netbootable executable for given platform.

This program should probably have 2 parts: an assembler and C one. Assembler one
handles BSS cleaning and other needed setup (on some platforms you may need
to switch modes or copy the executable to its definitive position). So your code
may look like (x86 assembly for illustration purposes)

@example
        .globl _start
_start:
	movl	$_bss_start, %edi
	movl	$_end, %ecx
	subl	%edi, %ecx
	xorl	%eax, %eax
	cld
	rep
	stosb
        call main
@end example

@example

static const char msg[] = "Hello, world";

void
putchar (int c)
@{
  ...
@}

void
main (void)
@{
  const char *ptr = msg;
  while (*ptr)
    putchar (*ptr++);
  while (1);
@}
@end example

Sometimes you need a third file: assembly stubs for ABI-compatibility.

Once this file is functional it's time to move it into GRUB2. The startup
assembly file goes to grub-core/kern/$cpu/$platform/startup.S. You should also
include grub/symbol.h and replace call to entry point with call to
EXT_C(grub_main). The C file goes to grub-core/kern/$cpu/$platform/init.c
and its entry point is renamed to void grub_machine_init (void). Keep final
infinite loop for now. Stubs file if any goes to
grub-core/kern/$cpu/$platform/callwrap.S. Sometimes either $cpu or $platform
is dropped if file is used on several cpus respectivelyplatforms.
Check those locations if they already have what you're looking for.

Then modify in configure.ac the following parts:

CPU names:

@example
case "$target_cpu" in
  i[[3456]]86)	target_cpu=i386 ;;
  amd64)	target_cpu=x86_64 ;;
  sparc)	target_cpu=sparc64 ;;
  s390x)	target_cpu=s390 ;;
  ...
esac
@end example

Sometimes CPU have additional architecture names which don't influence booting.
You might want to have some canonical name to avoid having bunch of identical
platforms with different names.

NOTE: it doesn't influence compile optimisations which depend solely on
chosen compiler and compile options.

@example
if test "x$with_platform" = x; then
  case "$target_cpu"-"$target_vendor" in
    i386-apple) platform=efi ;;
    i386-*) platform=pc ;;
    x86_64-apple) platform=efi ;;
    x86_64-*) platform=pc ;;
    powerpc-*) platform=ieee1275 ;;
    ...
  esac
else
  ...
fi
@end example

This part deals with guessing the platform from CPU and vendor. Sometimes you
need to use 32-bit mode for booting even if OS runs in 64-bit one. If so add
your platform to:

@example
case "$target_cpu"-"$platform" in
  x86_64-efi) ;;
  x86_64-emu) ;;
  x86_64-*) target_cpu=i386 ;;
  powerpc64-ieee1275) target_cpu=powerpc ;;
esac
@end example

Add your platform to the list of supported ones:

@example
case "$target_cpu"-"$platform" in
  i386-efi) ;;
  x86_64-efi) ;;
  i386-pc) ;;
  i386-multiboot) ;;
  i386-coreboot) ;;
  ...
esac
@end example

If explicit -m32 or -m64 is needed add it to:

@example
case "$target_cpu" in
  i386 | powerpc) target_m32=1 ;;
  x86_64 | sparc64) target_m64=1 ;;
esac
@end example

Finally you need to add a conditional to the following block:

@example
AM_CONDITIONAL([COND_mips_arc], [test x$target_cpu = xmips -a x$platform = xarc])
AM_CONDITIONAL([COND_sparc64_ieee1275], [test x$target_cpu = xsparc64 -a x$platform = xieee1275])
AM_CONDITIONAL([COND_powerpc_ieee1275], [test x$target_cpu = xpowerpc -a x$platform = xieee1275])
@end example

Next stop is gentpl.py. You need to add your platform to the list of supported
ones (sorry that this list is duplicated):

@example
GRUB_PLATFORMS = [ "emu", "i386_pc", "i386_efi", "i386_qemu", "i386_coreboot",
                   "i386_multiboot", "i386_ieee1275", "x86_64_efi",
                   "mips_loongson", "sparc64_ieee1275",
                   "powerpc_ieee1275", "mips_arc", "ia64_efi",
                   "mips_qemu_mips", "s390_mainframe" ]
@end example

You may also want already to add new platform to one or several of available
groups. In particular we always have a group for each CPU even when only
one platform for given CPU is available.

Then comes grub-core/Makefile.core.def. In the block ``kernel'' you'll need
to define ldflags for your platform ($cpu_$platform_ldflags). You also need to
declare startup asm file ($cpu_$platform_startup) as well as any other files
(e.g. init.c and callwrap.S) (e.g. $cpu_$platform = kern/$cpu/$platform/init.c).
At this stage you will also need to add dummy dl.c and cache.S with functions
grub_err_t grub_arch_dl_check_header (void *ehdr), grub_err_t
grub_arch_dl_relocate_symbols (grub_dl_t mod, void *ehdr) (dl.c) and
void grub_arch_sync_caches (void *address, grub_size_t len) (cache.S). They
won't be used for now.

You will need to create directory include/$cpu/$platform and a file
include/$cpu/types.h. The later folowing this template:

@example
#ifndef GRUB_TYPES_CPU_HEADER
#define GRUB_TYPES_CPU_HEADER	1

/* The size of void *.  */
#define GRUB_TARGET_SIZEOF_VOID_P	4

/* The size of long.  */
#define GRUB_TARGET_SIZEOF_LONG		4

/* mycpu is big-endian.  */
#define GRUB_TARGET_WORDS_BIGENDIAN	1
/* Alternatively: mycpu is little-endian.  */
#undef GRUB_TARGET_WORDS_BIGENDIAN

#endif /* ! GRUB_TYPES_CPU_HEADER */
@end example

You will also need to add a dummy file to datetime and setjmp modules to
avoid any of it having no files. It can be just completely empty at this stage.

You'll need to make grub-mkimage.c (util/grub_mkimage.c) aware of the needed
format. For most commonly used formats like ELF, PE, aout or raw the support
is already present and you'll need to make it follow the existant code paths
for your platform adding adjustments if necessary. When done compile:

@example
./autogen.sh
./configure --target=$cpu --with-platform=$platform TARGET_CC=.. OBJCOPY=... STRIP=...
make > /dev/null
@end example

And create image

@example
./grub-mkimage -d grub-core -O $format_id -o test.img
@end example

And it's time to test your test.img.

If it works next stage is to have heap, console and timer.

To have the heap working you need to determine which regions are suitable for
heap usage, allocate them from firmware and map (if applicable). Then call
grub_mm_init_region (vois *start, grub_size_t s) for every of this region.
As a shortcut for early port you can allocate right after _end or have
a big static array for heap. If you do you'll probably need to come back to
this later. As for output console you should distinguish between an array of
text, terminfo or graphics-based console. Many of real-world examples don't
fit perfectly into any of these categories but one of the models is easier
to be used as base. In second and third case you should add your platform to 
terminfokernel respectively videoinkernel group. A good example of array of
text is i386-pc (kern/i386/pc/init.c and term/i386/pc/console.c).
Of terminfo is ieee1275 (kern/ieee1275/init.c and term/ieee1275/console.c).
Of video is loongson (kern/mips/loongson/init.c). Note that terminfo has
to be inited in 2 stages: one before (to get at least rudimentary console
as early as possible) and another after the heap (to get full-featured console).
For the input there are string of keys, terminfo and direct hardware. For string
of keys look at i386-pc (same files), for termino ieee1275 (same files) and for
hardware loongson (kern/mips/loongson/init.c and term/at_keyboard.c).

For the timer you'll need to call grub_install_get_time_ms (...) with as sole
argument a function returning a grub_uint64_t of a number of milliseconds
elapsed since arbitrary point in the past.

Once these steps accomplished you can remove the inifinite loop and you should
be able to get to the minimal console. Next step is to have module loading
working. For this you'll need to fill kern/$cpu/dl.c and kern/$cpu/cache.S
with real handling of relocations and respectively the real sync of I and D
caches. Also you'll need to decide where in the image to store the modules.
Usual way is to have it concatenated at the end. In this case you'll need to
modify startup.S to copy modules out of bss to let's say ALIGN_UP (_end, 8)
before cleaning out bss. You'll probably find useful to add total_module_size
field to startup.S. In init.c you need to set grub_modbase to the address
where modules can be found. You may need grub_modules_get_end () to avoid
declaring the space occupied by modules as usable for heap. You can test modules
with:

@example
./grub-mkimage -d grub-core -O $format_id -o test.img hello
@end example

and then running ``hello'' in the shell.

Once this works, you should think of implementing disk access. Look around
disk/ for examples.

Then, very importantly, you probably need to implement the actual loader
(examples available in loader/)

Last step to have minimally usable port is to add support to grub-install to
put GRUB in a place where firmware or platform will pick it up.

Next steps are: filling datetime.c, setjmp.S, network (net/drivers),
video (video/), halt (lib/), reboot (lib/).

Please add your platform to Platform limitations and Supported kernels chapter
in user documentation and mention any steps you skipped which result in reduced
features or performance. Here is the quick checklist of features. Some of them
are less important than others and skipping them is completely ok, just needs
to be mentioned in user documentation.

@node Error Handling
@chapter Error Handling

Error handling in GRUB 2 is based on exception handling model. As C language
doesn't directly support exceptions, exception handling behavior is emulated
in software. 

When exception is raised, function must return to calling function. If calling
function does not provide handling of the exception it must return back to its
calling function and so on, until exception is handled. If exception is not
handled before prompt is displayed, error message will be shown to user.

Exception information is stored on @code{grub_errno} global variable. If
@code{grub_errno} variable contains value @code{GRUB_ERR_NONE}, there is no active
exception and application can continue normal processing. When @code{grub_errno} has
other value, it is required that application code either handles this error or
returns instantly to caller. If function is with return type @code{grub_err_t} is
about to return @code{GRUB_ERR_NONE}, it should not set @code{grub_errno} to that
value. Only set @code{grub_errno} in cases where there is error situation. 

Simple exception forwarder.
@example
grub_err_t
forwarding_example (void)
@{
  /* Call function that might cause exception.  */
  foobar ();

  /* No special exception handler, just forward possible exceptions.  */
  if (grub_errno != GRUB_ERR_NONE)
    @{
      return grub_errno;
    @}

  /* All is OK, do more processing.  */

  /* Return OK signal, to caller.  */
  return GRUB_ERR_NONE;
@}
@end example

Error reporting has two components, the actual error code (of type
@code{grub_err_t}) and textual message that will be displayed to user. List of
valid error codes is listed in header file @file{include/grub/err.h}. Textual
error message can contain any textual data. At time of writing, error message
can contain up to 256 characters (including terminating NUL). To ease error
reporting there is a helper function @code{grub_error} that allows easier
formatting of error messages and should be used instead of writing directly to
global variables.

Example of error reporting.
@example
grub_err_t
failing_example ()
@{
  return grub_error (GRUB_ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND, 
                     "Failed to read %s, tried %d times.",
                     "test.txt",
                     10);
@}
@end example

If there is a special reason that error code does not need to be taken account,
@code{grub_errno} can be zeroed back to @code{GRUB_ERR_NONE}. In cases like this all
previous error codes should have been handled correctly. This makes sure that
there are no unhandled exceptions.

Example of zeroing @code{grub_errno}.
@example
grub_err_t
probe_example ()
@{
  /* Try to probe device type 1.  */
  probe_for_device ();
  if (grub_errno == GRUB_ERR_NONE)
    @{
      /* Device type 1 was found on system.  */
      register_device ();
      return GRUB_ERR_NONE;
    @}
  /* Zero out error code.  */
  grub_errno = GRUB_ERR_NONE;

  /* No device type 1 found, try to probe device type 2.  */
  probe_for_device2 ();
  if (grub_errno == GRUB_ERR_NONE)
    @{
      /* Device type 2 was found on system.  */
      register_device2 ();
      return GRUB_ERR_NONE;
    @}
  /* Zero out error code.  */
  grub_errno = GRUB_ERR_NONE;

  /* Return custom error message.  */
  return grub_error (GRUB_ERR_UNKNOWN_DEVICE, "No device type 1 or 2 found.");
@}
@end example

Some times there is a need to continue processing even if there is a error
state in application. In situations like this, there is a needed to save old
error state and then call other functions that might fail. To aid in this,
there is a error stack implemented. Error state can be pushed to error stack
by calling function @code{grub_error_push ()}. When processing has been completed,
@code{grub_error_pop ()} can be used to pop error state from stack. Error stack
contains predefined amount of error stack items. Error stack is protected for
overflow and marks these situations so overflow error does not get unseen.
If there is no space available to store error message, it is simply discarded
and overflow will be marked as happened. When overflow happens, it most likely
will corrupt error stack consistency as for pushed error there is no matching
pop, but overflow message will be shown to inform user about the situation.
Overflow message will be shown at time when prompt is about to be drawn.

Example usage of error stack.
@example
/* Save possible old error message.  */
grub_error_push ();

/* Do your stuff here.  */
call_possibly_failing_function ();

if (grub_errno != GRUB_ERR_NONE)
  @{
    /* Inform rest of the code that there is error (grub_errno
       is set). There is no pop here as we want both error states 
       to be displayed.  */
    return;
  @}

/* Restore old error state by popping previous item from stack. */
grub_error_pop ();
@end example

@node Stack and heap size
@chapter Stack and heap size

On emu stack and heap are just normal host OS stack and heap. Stack is typically
8 MiB although it's OS-dependent.

On i386-pc, i386-coreboot, i386-qemu and i386-multiboot the stack is 60KiB.
All available space between 1MiB and 4GiB marks is part of heap.

On *-xen stack is 4MiB. If compiled for x86-64 with GCC 4.4 or later adressable
space is unlimited. When compiled for x86-64 with older GCC version adressable
space is limited to 2GiB. When compiling for i386 adressable space is limited
to 4GiB. All adressable pages except the ones for stack, GRUB binary, special
pages and page table are in the heap.

On *-efi GRUB uses same stack as EFI. If compiled for x86-64 with GCC 4.4 or
later adressable space is unlimited. When compiled for x86-64 with older GCC
version adressable space is limited to 2GiB. For all other platforms adressable
space is limited to 4GiB. GRUB allocates pages from EFI for its heap, at most
1.6 GiB.

On i386-ieee1275 and powerpc-ieee1275 GRUB uses same stack as IEEE1275.
It allocates at most 32MiB for its heap.

On sparc64-ieee1275 stack is 256KiB and heap is 2MiB.

On mips(el)-qemu_mips and mipsel-loongson stack is 2MiB (everything below
GRUB image) and everything above GRUB image (from 2MiB + kernel size)
until 256MiB is part of heap.

On mips-arc stack is 2MiB (everything below GRUB image) and everything above
GRUB image(from 2MiB + kernel size) until 128MiB is part of heap.

On mipsel-arc stack is 2MiB (everything below GRUB image which is not part
of ARC) and everything above GRUB image (from 7MiB + kernel size)
until 256MiB is part of heap.

On arm-uboot stack is 256KiB and heap is 2MiB.

@subsection grub_video_setup

@itemize
@item Prototype:
@example
grub_err_t
grub_video_setup (unsigned int width, unsigned int height, unsigned int mode_type);
@end example
@item Description:

Driver will use information provided to it to select best possible video mode and switch to it. Supported values for @code{mode_type} are @code{GRUB_VIDEO_MODE_TYPE_INDEX_COLOR} for index color modes, @code{GRUB_VIDEO_MODE_TYPE_RGB} for direct RGB color modes and @code{GRUB_VIDEO_MODE_TYPE_DOUBLE_BUFFERED} for double buffering. When requesting RGB mode, highest bits per pixel mode will be selected. When requesting Index color mode, mode with highest number of colors will be selected. If all parameters are specified as zero, video adapter will try to figure out best possible mode and initialize it, platform specific differences are allowed here. If there is no mode matching request, error X will be returned. If there are no problems, function returns @code{GRUB_ERR_NONE}.

This function also performs following task upon succesful mode switch. Active rendering target is changed to screen and viewport is maximized to allow whole screen to be used when performing graphics operations. In RGB modes, emulated palette gets 16 entries containing default values for VGA palette, other colors are defined as black. When switching to Indexed Color mode, driver may set default VGA palette to screen if the video card allows the operation.

Used to blit source render target to viewport in specified coordinates. If part of source render target is outside of viewport region, it will be clipped out. If blitting operator is specified and source contains alpha values, resulting pixel color components will be calculated using formula ((src_color * src_alpha) + (dst_color * (255 - src_alpha)) / 255, if target buffer has alpha, it will be set to src_alpha. Offsets affect render target position where data will be copied from. If data is looked out of bounds of render target, color value will be assumed to be transparent. Blitting operator @code{oper} specifies should source pixel replace data in screen or blend with pixel alpha value.

@node Introduction
@section Introduction

The goal of this format is to provide a bitmap font format that is simple to
use, compact, and cleanly supports Unicode.


@subsection Goals of the GRUB Font Format

@itemize
@item Simple to read and use.
Since GRUB will only be reading the font files,
we are more concerned with making the code to read the font simple than we
are with writing the font.

@item Compact storage.
The fonts will generally be stored in a small boot
partition where GRUB is located, and this may be on a removable storage
device such as a CD or USB flash drive where space is more limited than it
is on most hard drives.

@item Unicode.
GRUB should not have to deal with multiple character
encodings.  The font should always use Unicode character codes for simple
internationalization.
@end itemize

@subsection Why Another Font Format?

There are many existing bitmap font formats that GRUB could use.  However,
there are aspects of these formats that may make them less than suitable for
use in GRUB at this time:

@table @samp
@item BDF 
Inefficient storage; uses ASCII to describe properties and 
hexadecimal numbers in ASCII for the bitmap rows.
@item PCF  
Many format variations such as byte order and bitmap padding (rows
padded to byte, word, etc.) would result in more complex code to
handle the font format.
@end table

@node File Structure
@section File Structure

A file @strong{section} consists of a 4-byte name, a 32-bit big-endian length (not
including the name or length), and then @var{length} more section-type-specific 
bytes.

The standard file extension for PFF2 font files is @file{.pf2}.


@subsection Section Types

@table @samp
@item FILE
@strong{File type ID} (ASCII string).  This must be the first section in the file.  It has length 4
and the contents are the four bytes of the ASCII string @samp{PFF2}.

@item NAME
@strong{Font name} (ASCII string).  This is the full font name including family,
weight, style, and point size.  For instance, "Helvetica Bold Italic 14".

@item FAMI
@strong{Font family name} (ASCII string).  For instance, "Helvetica".  This should
be included so that intelligent font substitution can take place.

@item WEIG
@strong{Font weight} (ASCII string).  Valid values are @samp{bold} and @samp{normal}.
This should be included so that intelligent font substitution can take
place.

@item SLAN
@strong{Font slant} (ASCII string).  Valid values are @samp{italic} and @samp{normal}.
This should be included so that intelligent font substitution can take
place.

@item PTSZ
@strong{Font point size} (uint16be).

@item MAXW
@strong{Maximum character width in pixels} (uint16be).

@item MAXH
@strong{Maximum character height in pixels} (uint16be).

@item ASCE
@strong{Ascent in pixels} (uint16be).  @xref{Font Metrics}, for details.

@item DESC
@strong{Descent in pixels} (uint16be).  @xref{Font Metrics}, for details.

@item CHIX
@strong{Character index.}
The character index begins with a 32-bit big-endian unsigned integer
indicating the total size of the section, not including this size value.
For each character, there is an instance of the following entry structure:

@itemize
@item @strong{Unicode code point.} (32-bit big-endian integer.)

@item @strong{Storage flags.} (byte.)
       
@itemize
@item Bits 2..0: 

If equal to 000 binary, then the character data is stored
uncompressed beginning at the offset indicated by the character's
@strong{offset} value.

If equal to 001 binary, then the character data is stored within a 
compressed character definition block that begins at the offset 
within the file indicated by the character's @strong{offset} value.
@end itemize

@item @strong{Offset.} (32-bit big-endian integer.)

A marker that indicates the remainder of the file is data accessed via
the character index (CHIX) section.  When reading this font file, the rest
of the file can be ignored when scanning the sections.  The length should
be set to -1 (0xFFFFFFFF).

Supported data structures:

Character definition
Each character definition consists of:

@itemize
@item @strong{Width.}
Width of the bitmap in pixels.  The bitmap's extents 
represent the glyph's bounding box.  @code{uint16be}.

@item @strong{Height.}
Height of the bitmap in pixels.  The bitmap's extents
represent the glyph's bounding box.  @code{uint16be}.

@item @strong{X offset.}
The number of pixels to shift the bitmap by
horizontally before drawing the character. @code{int16be}.

@item @strong{Y offset.}
The number of pixels to shift the bitmap by
vertically before drawing the character. @code{int16be}.

@item @strong{Device width.}
The number of pixels to advance horizontally from
this character's origin to the origin of the next character.
@code{int16be}.

@item @strong{Bitmap data.}
This is encoded as a string of bits.  It is
organized as a row-major, top-down, left-to-right bitmap.  The most
significant bit of each byte is taken to be the leftmost or uppermost
bit in the byte.  For the sake of compact storage, rows are not padded
to byte boundaries (i.e., a single byte may contain bits belonging to
multiple rows).  The last byte of the bitmap @strong{is} padded with zero
bits in the bits positions to the right of the last used bit if the
bitmap data does not fill the last byte.  
         
The length of the @strong{bitmap data} field is (@var{width} * @var{height} + 7) / 8
using integer arithmetic, which is equivalent to ceil(@var{width} *
@var{height} / 8) using real number arithmetic.

It remains to be determined whether bitmap fonts usually make all
glyph bitmaps the same height, or if smaller glyphs are stored with
bitmaps having a lesser height.  In the latter case, the baseline
would have to be used to calculate the location the bitmap should be
anchored at on screen.
@end itemize

@end itemize
@end table

@node Font Metrics
@section Font Metrics

@itemize
@item Ascent.
The distance from the baseline to the top of most characters.
Note that in some cases characters may extend above the ascent.

@item Descent.
The distance from the baseline to the bottom of most characters.  Note that
in some cases characters may extend below the descent.
 
@item Leading.
The amount of space, in pixels, to leave between the descent of one line of
text and the ascent of the next line.  This metrics is not specified in the
current file format; instead, the font rendering engine calculates a
reasonable leading value based on the other font metrics.

@item Horizonal leading.
The amount of space, in pixels, to leave horizontally between the left and
right edges of two adjacent glyphs.  The @strong{device width} field determines
the effective leading value that is used to render the font.

@node Introduction_2
@section Introduction

The @samp{gfxmenu} module provides a graphical menu interface for GRUB 2.  It
functions as an alternative to the menu interface provided by the @samp{normal}
module, which uses the grub terminal interface to display a menu on a
character-oriented terminal.

The graphical menu uses the GRUB video API, which is currently for the VESA
BIOS extensions (VBE) 2.0+.  This is supported on the i386-pc platform.
However, the graphical menu itself does not depend on using VBE, so if another
GRUB video driver were implemented, the @samp{gfxmenu} graphical menu would work
on the new video driver as well.

@node GUI Components
@section GUI Components

The graphical menu implements a GUI component system that supports a
container-based layout system.  Components can be added to containers, and
containers (which are a type of component) can then be added to other
containers, to form a tree of components.  Currently, the root component of
this tree is a @samp{canvas} component, which allows manual layout of its child
components.

Components (non-container):

@itemize
@item label
@item image
@item progress_bar
@item circular_progress
@item list (currently hard coded to be a boot menu list)
@end itemize

Containers:

@itemize
@item canvas
@item hbox
@item vbox
@end itemize

The GUI component instances are created by the theme loader in
@file{gfxmenu/theme_loader.c} when a theme is loaded.  Theme files specify
statements such as @samp{+vbox@{ +label @{ text="Hello" @} +label@{ text="World" @} @}}
to add components to the component tree root.  By nesting the component
creation statements in the theme file, the instantiated components are nested
the same way.

When a component is added to a container, that new child is considered @strong{owned}
by the container.  Great care should be taken if the caller retains a
reference to the child component, since it will be destroyed if its parent
container is destroyed.  A better choice instead of storing a pointer to the
child component is to use the component ID to find the desired component.
Component IDs do not have to be unique (it is often useful to have multiple
components with an ID of "__timeout__", for instance).

In order to access and use components in the component tree, there are two
functions (defined in @file{gfxmenu/gui_util.c}) that are particularly useful:

@itemize

@item @code{grub_gui_find_by_id (root, id, callback, userdata)}:

This function ecursively traverses the component tree rooted at @var{root}, and
for every component that has an ID equal to @var{id}, calls the function pointed
to by @var{callback} with the matching component and the void pointer @var{userdata}
as arguments.  The callback function can do whatever is desired to use the
component passed in.

@item @code{grub_gui_iterate_recursively (root, callback, userdata)}:

This function calls the function pointed to by @var{callback} for every
component that is a descendant of @var{root} in the component tree.  When the
callback function is called, the component and the void pointer @var{userdata}
as arguments.  The callback function can do whatever is desired to use the
component passed in.
@end itemize

@node Command Line Window
@section Command Line Window

The terminal window used to provide command line access within the graphical
menu is managed by @file{gfxmenu/view.c}.  The @samp{gfxterm} terminal is used, and
it has been modified to allow rendering to an offscreen render target to allow
it to be composed into the double buffering system that the graphical menu
view uses.  This is bad for performance, however, so it would probably be a
good idea to make it possible to temporarily disable double buffering as long
as the terminal window is visible.  There are still unresolved problems that
occur when commands are executed from the terminal window that change the
graphics mode.  It's possible that making @code{grub_video_restore()} return to
the graphics mode that was in use before @code{grub_video_setup()} was called
might fix some of the problems.
