    NAME */

	AROS_LH1(ULONG, Wait,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(ULONG, signalSet, D0),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct ExecBase *, SysBase, 53, Exec)

/*  FUNCTION
	Wait until some signals are sent to the current task. If any signal
	of the specified set is already set when entering this function it
	returns immediately. Since almost any event in the OS can send a
	signal to your task if you specify it to do so signals are a very
	powerful mechanism.

    INPUTS
	signalSet - The set of signals to wait for.

    RESULT
	The set of active signals.

    NOTES
	Naturally it's not allowed to wait in supervisor mode.

	Calling Wait() breaks an active Disable() or Forbid().
