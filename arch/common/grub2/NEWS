New in 1.91 - 2005-10-15:

* Add support for LZO version 2.

* Support completion in the entry editor.

* Add VBE support.

* New commands, "search", "vbetest" and "vbeinfo".

* The option BOOT_IMAGE is passed to Linux.

* Add support for automatic decompression for gzip.

* Add support for terminfo and serial.

* Add support for x86_64.

* GRUB itself is a Multiboot-compliant kernel.

* Add new filesystems: XFS, SFS, and AFFS.


New in 1.90 - 2005-08-07:

* Rename the project name PUPA to GRUB. Now this version is the
  developmental version of GRUB officially.

* The GRUB emulator ``grub-emu'' is added.

* Add support for newworld Mac. This should work with other
  PowerPC-based machines as well, if they use IEEE 1275
  (Open Firmware).

* Too many changes to describe. Look at ChangeLog for more details.


New in 0.7:

* Problems in cross-compiling PUPA are fixed.

* Use -mrtd and -mregparm=3 to reduce the generated code sizes.	This
  means that any missing prototypes could be fatal. Also, you must take
  care when writing assembly code. See the comments at the beginning of
  startup.S, for more details.

* New utility, ``pupa-setup''. This sets up PUPA to make it bootable
  from a real disk.

* New commands, "prefix", "insmod", "rmmod" and "lsmod" are added into
  the rescue mode to manipulate PUPA modules.

* Linux support is added. Initrd is not support yet.

* Reduce the size of a core image significantly by compressing a large
  part of the core image and decompressing itself at boot time. The
  currently used algorithm is LZO (more precisely, LZO1X-999). So you
  have to install LZO to build PUPA. See
  <http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/>, for more information.


New in 0.6 - 2002-12-27, Yoshinori K. Okuji:

* The chainloader and the FAT filesystem are modularized.

* The structure of the source tree is a bit changed.

* Support for building loadable modules is added.

* Some generic parts of pupa-mkimage are segregated.

* Some documentation files are added, according to the GNU Coding
  Standards.
