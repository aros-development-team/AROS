Before working on anything in this file, it's very important that you
make contact with the core GRUB developers. Things herein might be
slightly out of date or otherwise not easy to understand at first
glance. So write to <grub-devel@gnu.org> first.

Priorities:
  Reported bugs generally have top priority.
  Non-reported and non-encountered bugs (things we know don't work,
    but don't really impede things) have lower priority.
  Things in this file are ranked with one to three !; the more, the
  higher priority.


* Add more filesystems (such as jfs, xfs and reiserfs). !

* Add journal playback support to ext2fs (so it will become ext3fs).

* Add support for internationalization. !!!

* Add more loaders (such as NetBSD and FreeBSD). !!

* Implement a more friendly installer.

* Add more terminals (such as serial). !

* Implement a normal mode. !!!

* Write a manual.

* Add support for compressed files.

* Add support for network devices.

* Fix the graphics mode completely and improve it to support VESA
  as well as VGA modes. !

* Add a fancy menu interface which utilizes the graphics mode
  extensively with many eye-candies. This is important to beat
  GRUB legacy. :)

* Audit util/powerpc/ieee1275/grub-mkimage.c for endianness fixes.
