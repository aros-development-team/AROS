	AROS_LH1(void, Reschedule,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(struct Task *, task, A0),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct ExecBase *, SysBase, 8, Exec)

/*  FUNCTION
	Reschedule will place the task into one of Execs internal task
	lists. Which list it is placed in will depend upon whether the
	task is ready to run, or whether it is waiting for an external
	event to awaken it.

	It is possible that in the future, more efficient schedulers
	will be implemented. In which case this is the function that they
	need to implement.

	You should not do any costly calculations since you will be
	running in interupt mode.

    INPUTS
	task    -   The task to insert into the list.

    RESULT
	The task will be inserted into one of Exec's task lists.

    NOTES
	Not actually complete yet. Some of the task states don't have any
	supplied action.

    EXAMPLE

    BUGS
	Only in relation to the comments within about low-priority tasks
	not getting any processor time.
