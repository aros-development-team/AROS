Motivation
**********

   Every operating system ever created tends to have its own boot
loader.  Installing a new operating system on a machine generally
involves installing a whole new set of boot mechanisms, each with
completely different install-time and boot-time user interfaces.
Getting multiple operating systems to coexist reliably on one machine
through typical "chaining" mechanisms can be a nightmare. There is
little or no choice of boot loaders for a particular operating system
-- if the one that comes with the operating system doesn't do exactly
what you want, or doesn't work on your machine, you're screwed.

   While we may not be able to fix this problem in existing commercial
operating systems, it shouldn't be too difficult for a few people in the
free operating system communities to put their heads together and solve
this problem for the popular free operating systems. That's what this
specification aims for. Basically, it specifies an interface between a
boot loader and a operating system, such that any complying boot loader
should be able to load any complying operating system. This
specification does _not_ specify how boot loaders should work -- only
how they must interface with the operating system being loaded.

Terminology
***********

   Throughout this document, the term "boot loader" means whatever
program or set of programs loads the image of the final operating system
to be run on the machine. The boot loader may itself consist of several
stages, but that is an implementation detail not relevant to this
specification. Only the _final_ stage of the boot loader -- the stage
that eventually transfers control to the operating system -- needs to
follow the rules specified in this document in order to be "MultiBoot
compliant"; earlier boot loader stages can be designed in whatever way
is most convenient.

   The term "OS image" is used to refer to the initial binary image
that the boot loader loads into memory and transfers control to start
the operating system. The OS image is typically an executable containing
the operating system kernel.

   The term "boot module" refers to other auxiliary files that the boot
loader loads into memory along with the OS image, but does not interpret
in any way other than passing their locations to the operating system
when it is invoked.

Architecture
============

   This specification is primarily targeted at PC, since they are the
most common and have the largest variety of operating systems and boot
loaders. However, to the extent that certain other architectures may
need a boot specification and do not have one already, a variation of
this specification, stripped of the x86-specific details, could be
adopted for them as well.


File: multiboot.info,  Node: Operating systems,  Next: Boot sources,  Prev: Architecture,  Up: Scope and requirements

Operating systems
=================

   This specification is targeted toward free 32-bit operating systems
that can be fairly easily modified to support the specification without
going through lots of bureaucratic rigmarole. The particular free
operating systems that this specification is being primarily designed
for are Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Mach, and VSTa. It is hoped that other
emerging free operating systems will adopt it from the start, and thus
immediately be able to take advantage of existing boot loaders. It would
be nice if commercial operating system vendors eventually adopted this
specification as well, but that's probably a pipe dream.


File: multiboot.info,  Node: Boot sources,  Next: Boot-time configuration,  Prev: Operating systems,  Up: Scope and requirements

Boot sources
============

   It should be possible to write compliant boot loaders that load the
OS image from a variety of sources, including floppy disk, hard disk,
and across a network.

   Disk-based boot loaders may use a variety of techniques to find the
relevant OS image and boot module data on disk, such as by
interpretation of specific file systems (e.g. the BSD/Mach boot loader),
using precalculated "block lists" (e.g. LILO), loading from a special
"boot partition" (e.g. OS/2), or even loading from within another
operating system (e.g. the VSTa boot code, which loads from DOS).
Similarly, network-based boot loaders could use a variety of network
hardware and protocols.

   It is hoped that boot loaders will be created that support multiple
loading mechanisms, increasing their portability, robustness, and
user-friendliness.


File: multiboot.info,  Node: Boot-time configuration,  Next: Convenience to the operating system,  Prev: Boot sources,  Up: Scope and requirements

Boot-time configuration
=======================

   It is often necessary for one reason or another for the user to be
able to provide some configuration information to the operating system
dynamically at boot time. While this specification should not dictate
how this configuration information is obtained by the boot loader, it
should provide a standard means for the boot loader to pass such
information to the operating system.


File: multiboot.info,  Node: Convenience to the operating system,  Next: Boot modules,  Prev: Boot-time configuration,  Up: Scope and requirements

Convenience to the operating system
===================================

   OS images should be easy to generate. Ideally, an OS image should
simply be an ordinary 32-bit executable file in whatever file format the
operating system normally uses. It should be possible to `nm' or
disassemble OS images just like normal executables. Specialized tools
should not be needed to create OS images in a _special_ file format. If
this means shifting some work from the operating system to the boot
loader, that is probably appropriate, because all the memory consumed
by the boot loader will typically be made available again after the
boot process is created, whereas every bit of code in the OS image
typically has to remain in memory forever. The operating system should
not have to worry about getting into 32-bit mode initially, because mode
switching code generally needs to be in the boot loader anyway in order
to load operating system data above the 1MB boundary, and forcing the
operating system to do this makes creation of OS images much more
difficult.

   Unfortunately, there is a horrendous variety of executable file
formats even among free Unix-like PC-based operating systems --
generally a different format for each operating system. Most of the
relevant free operating systems use some variant of a.out format, but
some are moving to ELF. It is highly desirable for boot loaders not to
have to be able to interpret all the different types of executable file
formats in existence in order to load the OS image -- otherwise the
boot loader effectively becomes operating system specific again.

   This specification adopts a compromise solution to this problem.
Multiboot compliant boot images always contain a magic "Multiboot
header" (*note OS image format::), which allows the boot loader to load
the image without having to understand numerous a.out variants or other
executable formats. This magic header does not need to be at the very
beginning of the executable file, so kernel images can still conform to
the local a.out format variant in addition to being Multiboot compliant.


File: multiboot.info,  Node: Boot modules,  Prev: Convenience to the operating system,  Up: Scope and requirements

Boot modules
============

   Many modern operating system kernels, such as those of VSTa and
Mach, do not by themselves contain enough mechanism to get the system
fully operational: they require the presence of additional software
modules at boot time in order to access devices, mount file systems,
etc. While these additional modules could be embedded in the main OS
image along with the kernel itself, and the resulting image be split
apart manually by the operating system when it receives control, it is
often more flexible, more space-efficient, and more convenient to the
operating system and user if the boot loader can load these additional
modules independently in the first place.

   Thus, this specification should provide a standard method for a boot
loader to indicate to the operating system what auxiliary boot modules
were loaded, and where they can be found. Boot loaders don't have to
support multiple boot modules, but they are strongly encouraged to,
because some operating systems will be unable to boot without them.

Details
*******

   There are three main aspects of the boot loader/OS image interface:

  1. The format of the OS image as seen by the boot loader.

  2. The state of the machine when the boot loader starts the operating
     system.

  3. The format of the information passed by the boot loader to the
     operating system.

* Menu:

* OS image format::
* Machine state::
* Boot information format::


File: multiboot.info,  Node: OS image format,  Next: Machine state,  Up: Details

OS image format
===============

   An OS image is generally just an ordinary 32-bit executable file in
the standard format for that particular operating system, except that
it may be linked at a non-default load address to avoid loading on top
of the PC's I/O region or other reserved areas, and of course it can't
use shared libraries or other fancy features.

   Unfortunately, the exact meaning of the text, data, bss, and entry
fields of a.out headers tends to vary widely between different
executable flavors, and it is sometimes very difficult to distinguish
one flavor from another (e.g. Linux ZMAGIC executables and Mach ZMAGIC
executables). Furthermore, there is no simple, reliable way of
determining at what address in memory the text segment is supposed to
start. Therefore, this specification requires that an additional header,
known as a "Multiboot header", appear somewhere near the beginning of
the executable file. In general it should come _as early as possible_,
and is typically embedded in the beginning of the text segment after
the _real_ executable header. It _must_ be contained completely within
the first 8192 bytes of the executable file, and must be longword
(32-bit) aligned. These rules allow the boot loader to find and
synchronize with the text segment in the a.out file without knowing
beforehand the details of the a.out variant. The layout of the header
is as follows:

             +-------------------+
     0       | magic: 0x1BADB002 |   (required)
     4       | flags             |   (required)
     8       | checksum          |   (required)
             +-------------------+
     12      | header_addr       |   (present if flags[16] is set)
     16      | load_addr         |   (present if flags[16] is set)
     20      | load_end_addr     |   (present if flags[16] is set)
     24      | bss_end_addr      |   (present if flags[16] is set)
     28      | entry_addr        |   (present if flags[16] is set)
             +-------------------+
     32      | mode_type         |   (present if flags[2] is set)
     36      | width             |   (present if flags[2] is set)
     40      | height            |   (present if flags[2] is set)
     44      | depth             |   (present if flags[2] is set)
             +-------------------+

   All fields are in little-endian byte order, of course. The first
field is the magic number identifying the header, which must be the hex
value 0x1BADB002.

   The `flags' field specifies features that the OS image requests or
requires of the boot loader. Bits 0-15 indicate requirements; if the
boot loader sees any of these bits set but doesn't understand the flag
or can't fulfill the requirements it indicates for some reason, it must
notify the user and fail to load the OS image. Bits 16-31 indicate
optional features; if any bits in this range are set but the boot loader
doesn't understand them, it can simply ignore them and proceed as
usual. Naturally, all as-yet-undefined bits in the `flags' word must be
set to zero in OS images. This way, the `flags' fields serves for
version control as well as simple feature selection.

   If bit 0 in the `flags' word is set, then all boot modules loaded
along with the operating system must be aligned on page (4KB)
boundaries. Some operating systems expect to be able to map the pages
containing boot modules directly into a paged address space during
startup, and thus need the boot modules to be page-aligned.

   If bit 1 in the `flags' word is set, then information on available
memory via at least the `mem_*' fields of the Multiboot information
structure (*note Boot information format::) must be included. If the
bootloader is capable of passing a memory map (the `mmap_*' fields) and
one exists, then it must be included as well.

   If bit 2 in the `flags' word is set, information about the video
mode table, defined later, must be available to the kernel.

   Also, information about a preferred default mode can be specified in
the `mode_type', `width', `height' and `depth' fields. This is only a
_recommended_ mode by the kernel. If the mode exists, the boot loader
should set it if the user hasn't specified a mode. If not, it should
fall back to a similar mode, if available.

   Valid numbers for `mode_type' is 0 for linear graphics mode and 1
for EGA-standard text mode. Everything else is reserved for future
expansion. Please note that even if you set this field to indicate that
you want a graphics mode, you might get a text mode.

   `width' and `height' is specified in pixels, if graphics mode, or
characters in EGA text mode. `depth' is given in bits per pixel for
graphics, or zero for EGA text modes.

   Any, some or all of those three fields may be set to zero,
indicating to the boot loader that no preference is given. This makes
it possible for a kernel to just say it wants a 32-bit resolution, for
example.

   If bit 16 in the `flags' word is set, then the fields at offsets
8-24 in the Multiboot header are valid, and the boot loader should use
them instead of the fields in the actual executable header to calculate
where to load the OS image. This information does not need to be
provided if the kernel image is in ELF format, but it _must_ be
provided if the images is in a.out format or in some other format.
Compliant boot loaders must be able to load images that either are in
ELF format or contain the load address information embedded in the
Multiboot header; they may also directly support other executable
formats, such as particular a.out variants, but are not required to.

   All of the address fields enabled by flag bit 16 are physical
addresses.  The meaning of each is as follows:

`header_addr'
     Contains the address corresponding to the beginning of the
     Multiboot header -- the physical memory location at which the
     magic value is supposed to be loaded. This field serves to
     "synchronize" the mapping between OS image offsets and physical
     memory addresses.

`load_addr'
     Contains the physical address of the beginning of the text
     segment. The offset in the OS image file at which to start loading
     is defined by the offset at which the header was found, minus
     (header_addr - load_addr). load_addr must be less than or equal to
     header_addr.

`load_end_addr'
     Contains the physical address of the end of the data segment.
     (load_end_addr - load_addr) specifies how much data to load.  This
     implies that the text and data segments must be consecutive in the
     OS image; this is true for existing a.out executable formats.

`bss_end_addr'
     Contains the physical address of the end of the bss segment. The
     boot loader initializes this area to zero, and reserves the memory
     it occupies to avoid placing boot modules and other data relevant
     to the operating system in that area.

`entry_addr'
     The physical address to which the boot loader should jump in order
     to start running the operating system.

   The checksum is a 32-bit unsigned value which, when added to the
other required fields, must have a 32-bit unsigned sum of zero.


File: multiboot.info,  Node: Machine state,  Next: Boot information format,  Prev: OS image format,  Up: Details

Machine state
=============

   When the boot loader invokes the 32-bit operating system, the machine
must have the following state:

   * `CS' must be a 32-bit read/execute code segment with an offset of 0
     and a limit of 0xFFFFFFFF.

   * `DS', `ES', `FS', `GS', and `SS' must be a 32-bit read/write data
     segment with an offset of 0 and a limit of 0xFFFFFFFF.

   * The address 20 line must be usable for standard linear 32-bit
     addressing of memory (in standard PC hardware, it is wired to 0 at
     bootup, forcing addresses in the 1-2 MB range to be mapped to the
     0-1 MB range, 3-4 is mapped to 2-3, etc.).

   * Paging must be turned off.

   * The processor interrupt flag must be turned off.

   * `EAX' must contain the magic value 0x2BADB002; the presence of this
     value indicates to the operating system that it was loaded by a
     Multiboot-compliant boot loader (e.g. as opposed to another type
     of boot loader that the operating system can also be loaded from).

   * `EBX' must contain the 32-bit physical address of the Multiboot
     information structure provided by the boot loader (*note Boot
     information format::).

   All other processor registers and flag bits are undefined. This
includes, in particular:

   * `ESP': the 32-bit operating system must create its own stack as
     soon as it needs one.

   * `GDTR': Even though the segment registers are set up as described
     above, the `GDTR' may be invalid, so the operating system must not
     load any segment registers (even just reloading the same values!)
     until it sets up its own `GDT'.

   * `IDTR': The operating system must leave interrupts disabled until
     it sets up its own `IDT'.

   However, other machine state should be left by the boot loader in
"normal working order", i.e. as initialized by the BIOS (or DOS, if
that's what the boot loader runs from). In other words, the operating
system should be able to make BIOS calls and such after being loaded,
as long as it does not overwrite the BIOS data structures before doing
so. Also, the boot loader must leave the PIC programmed with the normal
BIOS/DOS values, even if it changed them during the switch to 32-bit
mode.


File: multiboot.info,  Node: Boot information format,  Prev: Machine state,  Up: Details

Boot information format
=======================

   Upon entry to the operating system, the `EBX' register contains the
physical address of a "Multiboot information" data structure, through
which the boot loader communicates vital information to the operating
system. The operating system can use or ignore any parts of the
structure as it chooses; all information passed by the boot loader is
advisory only.

   The Multiboot information structure and its related substructures
may be placed anywhere in memory by the boot loader (with the exception
of the memory reserved for the kernel and boot modules, of course). It
is the operating system's responsibility to avoid overwriting this
memory until it is done using it.

   The format of the Multiboot information structure (as defined so far)
follows:

             +-------------------+
     0       | flags             |    (required)
             +-------------------+
     4       | mem_lower         |    (present if flags[0] is set)
     8       | mem_upper         |    (present if flags[0] is set)
             +-------------------+
     12      | boot_device       |    (present if flags[1] is set)
             +-------------------+
     16      | cmdline           |    (present if flags[2] is set)
             +-------------------+
     20      | mods_count        |    (present if flags[3] is set)
     24      | mods_addr         |    (present if flags[3] is set)
             +-------------------+
     28 - 40 | syms              |    (present if flags[4] or
             |                   |                flags[5] is set)
             +-------------------+
     44      | mmap_length       |    (present if flags[6] is set)
     48      | mmap_addr         |    (present if flags[6] is set)
             +-------------------+
     52      | drives_count      |    (present if flags[7] is set)
     56      | drives_addr       |    (present if flags[7] is set)
             +-------------------+
     60      | config_table      |    (present if flags[8] is set)
             +-------------------+
     64      | boot_loader_name  |    (present if flags[9] is set)
             +-------------------+
     68 - ?? | apm_table         |    (present if flags[10] is set)
             +-------------------+
     ?? - ?? | graphics_table    |    (present if flags[11] is set)
             +-------------------+

   The first longword indicates the presence and validity of other
fields in the Multiboot information structure. All as-yet-undefined
bits must be set to zero by the boot loader. Any set bits that the
operating system does not understand should be ignored. Thus, the
`flags' field also functions as a version indicator, allowing the
Multiboot information structure to be expanded in the future without
breaking anything.

   If bit 0 in the `flags' word is set, then the `mem_*' fields are
valid. `mem_lower' and `mem_upper' indicate the amount of lower and
upper memory, respectively, in kilobytes. Lower memory starts at
address 0, and upper memory starts at address 1 megabyte. The maximum
possible value for lower memory is 640 kilobytes. The value returned for
upper memory is maximally the address of the first upper memory hole
minus 1 megabyte. It is not guaranteed to be this value.

   If bit 1 in the `flags' word is set, then the `boot_device' field is
valid, and indicates which BIOS disk device the boot loader loaded the
OS image from. If the OS image was not loaded from a BIOS disk, then
this field must not be present (bit 3 must be clear). The operating
system may use this field as a hint for determining its own "root"
device, but is not required to. The `boot_device' field is laid out in
four one-byte subfields as follows:

     +-------+-------+-------+-------+
     | drive | part1 | part2 | part3 |
     +-------+-------+-------+-------+

   The first byte contains the BIOS drive number as understood by the
BIOS INT 0x13 low-level disk interface: e.g. 0x00 for the first floppy
disk or 0x80 for the first hard disk.

   The three remaining bytes specify the boot partition. `part1'
specifies the "top-level" partition number, `part2' specifies a
"sub-partition" in the top-level partition, etc. Partition numbers
always start from zero. Unused partition bytes must be set to 0xFF. For
example, if the disk is partitioned using a simple one-level DOS
partitioning scheme, then `part1' contains the DOS partition number,
and `part2' and `part3' are both 0xFF. As another example, if a disk is
partitioned first into DOS partitions, and then one of those DOS
partitions is subdivided into several BSD partitions using BSD's
"disklabel" strategy, then `part1' contains the DOS partition number,
`part2' contains the BSD sub-partition within that DOS partition, and
`part3' is 0xFF.

   DOS extended partitions are indicated as partition numbers starting
from 4 and increasing, rather than as nested sub-partitions, even
though the underlying disk layout of extended partitions is
hierarchical in nature. For example, if the boot loader boots from the
second extended partition on a disk partitioned in conventional DOS
style, then `part1' will be 5, and `part2' and `part3' will both be
0xFF.

   If bit 2 of the `flags' longword is set, the `cmdline' field is
valid, and contains the physical address of the command line to be
passed to the kernel. The command line is a normal C-style
zero-terminated string.

   If bit 3 of the `flags' is set, then the `mods' fields indicate to
the kernel what boot modules were loaded along with the kernel image,
and where they can be found. `mods_count' contains the number of
modules loaded; `mods_addr' contains the physical address of the first
module structure. `mods_count' may be zero, indicating no boot modules
were loaded, even if bit 1 of `flags' is set. Each module structure is
formatted as follows:

             +-------------------+
     0       | mod_start         |
     4       | mod_end           |
             +-------------------+
     8       | string            |
             +-------------------+
     12      | reserved (0)      |
             +-------------------+

   The first two fields contain the start and end addresses of the boot
module itself. The `string' field provides an arbitrary string to be
associated with that particular boot module; it is a zero-terminated
ASCII string, just like the kernel command line. The `string' field may
be 0 if there is no string associated with the module. Typically the
string might be a command line (e.g. if the operating system treats boot
modules as executable programs), or a pathname (e.g. if the operating
system treats boot modules as files in a file system), but its exact use
is specific to the operating system. The `reserved' field must be set
to 0 by the boot loader and ignored by the operating system.

   *Caution:* Bits 4 & 5 are mutually exclusive.

   If bit 4 in the `flags' word is set, then the following fields in
the Multiboot information structure starting at byte 28 are valid:

             +-------------------+
     28      | tabsize           |
     32      | strsize           |
     36      | addr              |
     40      | reserved (0)      |
             +-------------------+

   These indicate where the symbol table from an a.out kernel image can
be found. `addr' is the physical address of the size (4-byte unsigned
long) of an array of a.out format "nlist" structures, followed
immediately by the array itself, then the size (4-byte unsigned long) of
a set of zero-terminated ASCII strings (plus sizeof(unsigned long) in
this case), and finally the set of strings itself. `tabsize' is equal
to its size parameter (found at the beginning of the symbol section),
and `strsize' is equal to its size parameter (found at the beginning of
the string section) of the following string table to which the symbol
table refers. Note that `tabsize' may be 0, indicating no symbols, even
if bit 4 in the `flags' word is set.

   If bit 5 in the `flags' word is set, then the following fields in
the Multiboot information structure starting at byte 28 are valid:

             +-------------------+
     28      | num               |
     32      | size              |
     36      | addr              |
     40      | shndx             |
             +-------------------+

   These indicate where the section header table from an ELF kernel is,
the size of each entry, number of entries, and the string table used as
the index of names. They correspond to the `shdr_*' entries
(`shdr_num', etc.) in the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)
specification in the program header. All sections are loaded, and the
physical address fields of the ELF section header then refer to where
the sections are in memory (refer to the i386 ELF documentation for
details as to how to read the section header(s)). Note that `shdr_num'
may be 0, indicating no symbols, even if bit 5 in the `flags' word is
set.

   If bit 6 in the `flags' word is set, then the `mmap_*' fields are
valid, and indicate the address and length of a buffer containing a
memory map of the machine provided by the BIOS. `mmap_addr' is the
address, and `mmap_length' is the total size of the buffer. The buffer
consists of one or more of the following size/structure pairs (`size'
is really used for skipping to the next pair):

             +-------------------+
     -4      | size              |
             +-------------------+
     0       | base_addr_low     |
     4       | base_addr_high    |
     8       | length_low        |
     12      | length_high       |
     16      | type              |
             +-------------------+

   where `size' is the size of the associated structure in bytes, which
can be greater than the minimum of 20 bytes. `base_addr_low' is the
lower 32 bits of the starting address, and `base_addr_high' is the
upper 32 bits, for a total of a 64-bit starting address. `length_low'
is the lower 32 bits of the size of the memory region in bytes, and
`length_high' is the upper 32 bits, for a total of a 64-bit length.
`type' is the variety of address range represented, where a value of 1
indicates available RAM, and all other values currently indicated a
reserved area.

   The map provided is guaranteed to list all standard RAM that should
be available for normal use.

   If bit 7 in the `flags' is set, then the `drives_*' fields are
valid, and indicate the address of the physical address of the first
drive structure and the number of drive structures. `drives_addr' is
the address, and `drives_count' is the number. `drives_count' may be
zero. Each drive structure is formatted as follows:

             +-------------------+
     0       | drive_number      |
             +-------------------+
     1       | drive_mode        |
             +-------------------+
     2       | drive_cylinders   |
     4       | drive_heads       |
     5       | drive_sectors     |
             +-------------------+
     6       | drive_ports       |
             +-------------------+
     10      | reserved (0)      |
             +-------------------+

   The `drive_number' field contains the BIOS drive number. The
`drive_mode' field represents the access mode used by the boot loader.
Currently, the following modes are defined:

`0'
     CHS mode (traditional cylinder/head/sector addressing mode).

`1'
     LBA mode (Logical Block Addressing mode).

   The three fields, `drive_cylinders', `drive_heads' and
`drive_sectors', indicate the geometry of the drive detected by the
BIOS. `drive_cylinders' contains the number of the cylinders.
`drive_heads' contains the number of the heads. `drive_sectors'
contains the number of the sectors per track.

   The `drive_ports' field contains the physical address of the array
of the I/O ports used for the drive in the BIOS code. The array
consists of zero or more unsigned two-bytes integers, and is terminated
with zero. Note that the array may contain any number of I/O ports that
are not related to the drive actually (such as DMA controller's ports).

   The last field `reserved' is reserved for future use, and must be
zero. The size is four bytes.

   If bit 8 in the `flags' is set, then the `config_table' field is
valid, and indicates the address of the ROM configuration table
returned by the "GET CONFIGURATION" BIOS call. If the BIOS call fails,
then the size of the table must be _zero_.

   If bit 9 in the `flags' is set, the `boot_loader_name' field is
valid, and contains the physical address of the name of the boot loader
booting the kernel. The name is a normal C-style zero-terminated string.

   If bit 11 in the `flags' is set, video mode information is available
in the mode table. This should only be done if the kernel has indicated
in the `Multiboot Header' that it accepts graphics modes.

   The mode table looks like this:


             +----------------------+
     0       | mode_type            |
     4       | width                |
     8       | height               |
     12      | depth                |
     16      | frame_buffer_address |
             +----------------------+

   Valid numbers for `mode_type' is 0 for linear graphics mode and 1
for EGA-standard text mode. Everything else is reserved for future
expansion.

   `width' and `height' is specified in pixels, if graphics mode, or
characters in EGA text mode. `depth' is given in bits per pixel for
graphics, or unused for EGA text mode.

   `frame_buffer_address' specifies the physical start address of the
linear frame buffer. This is valid for both graphics and text modes.

Notes on PC
===========

   In reference to bit 0 of the `flags' parameter in the Multiboot
information structure, if the bootloader in question uses older BIOS
interfaces, or the newest ones are not available (see description about
bit 6), then a maximum of either 15 or 63 megabytes of memory may be
reported. It is _highly_ recommended that boot loaders perform a
thorough memory probe.

   In reference to bit 1 of the `flags' parameter in the Multiboot
information structure, it is recognized that determination of which
BIOS drive maps to which device driver in an operating system is
non-trivial, at best. Many kludges have been made to various operating
systems instead of solving this problem, most of them breaking under
many conditions. To encourage the use of general-purpose solutions to
this problem, there are 2 BIOS device mapping techniques (*note BIOS
device mapping techniques::).

   In reference to bit 6 of the `flags' parameter in the Multiboot
information structure, it is important to note that the data structure
used there (starting with `BaseAddrLow') is the data returned by the
INT 15h, AX=E820h -- Query System Address Map call. See *Note Query
System Address Map: (grub.info)Query System Address Map, for more
information. The interface here is meant to allow a boot loader to work
unmodified with any reasonable extensions of the BIOS interface,
passing along any extra data to be interpreted by the operating system
as desired.

BIOS device mapping techniques
==============================

   Both of these techniques should be usable from any PC operating
system, and neither require any special support in the drivers
themselves. This section will be flushed out into detailed
explanations, particularly for the I/O restriction technique.

   The general rule is that the data comparison technique is the quick
and dirty solution. It works most of the time, but doesn't cover all the
bases, and is relatively simple.

   The I/O restriction technique is much more complex, but it has
potential to solve the problem under all conditions, plus allow access
of the remaining BIOS devices when not all of them have operating system
drivers.

* Data comparison technique::
* I/O restriction technique::


File: multiboot.info,  Node: Data comparison technique,  Next: I/O restriction technique,  Up: BIOS device mapping techniques

Data comparison technique
-------------------------

   Before activating _any_ of the device drivers, gather enough data
from similar sectors on each of the disks such that each one can be
uniquely identified.

   After activating the device drivers, compare data from the drives
using the operating system drivers. This should hopefully be sufficient
to provide such a mapping.

   Problems:

  1. The data on some BIOS devices might be identical (so the part
     reading the drives from the BIOS should have some mechanism to give
     up).

  2. There might be extra drives not accessible from the BIOS which are
     identical to some drive used by the BIOS (so it should be capable
     of giving up there as well).


File: multiboot.info,  Node: I/O restriction technique,  Prev: Data comparison technique,  Up: BIOS device mapping techniques

I/O restriction technique
-------------------------

   This first step may be unnecessary, but first create copy-on-write
mappings for the device drivers writing into PC RAM. Keep the original
copies for the "clean BIOS virtual machine" to be created later.

   For each device driver brought online, determine which BIOS devices
become inaccessible by:

  1. Create a "clean BIOS virtual machine".

  2. Set the I/O permission map for the I/O area claimed by the device
     driver to no permissions (neither read nor write).

  3. Access each device.

  4. Record which devices succeed, and those which try to access the
     "restricted" I/O areas (hopefully, this will be an "xor"
     situation).

   For each device driver, given how many of the BIOS devices were
subsumed by it (there should be no gaps in this list), it should be easy
to determine which devices on the controller these are.

   In general, you have at most 2 disks from each controller given BIOS
numbers, but they pretty much always count from the lowest logically
numbered devices on the controller.

Example OS code
===============

   In this distribution, the example Multiboot kernel `kernel' is
included. The kernel just prints out the Multiboot information structure
on the screen, so you can make use of the kernel to test a
Multiboot-compliant boot loader and for reference to how to implement a
Multiboot kernel. The source files can be found under the directory
`docs' in the GRUB distribution.

   The kernel `kernel' consists of only three files: `boot.S',
`kernel.c' and `multiboot.h'. The assembly source `boot.S' is written
in GAS (*note GNU assembler: (as.info)Top.), and contains the Multiboot
information structure to comply with the specification. When a
Multiboot-compliant boot loader loads and execute it, it initialize the
stack pointer and `EFLAGS', and then call the function `cmain' defined
in `kernel.c'. If `cmain' returns to the callee, then it shows a
message to inform the user of the halt state and stops forever until
you push the reset key. The file `kernel.c' contains the function
`cmain', which checks if the magic number passed by the boot loader is
valid and so on, and some functions to print messages on the screen.
The file `multiboot.h' defines some macros, such as the magic number
for the Multiboot header, the Multiboot header structure and the
Multiboot information structure.

Other Multiboot kernels
-----------------------

   Other useful information should be available in Multiboot kernels,
such as GNU Mach and Fiasco <http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/fiasco/>. And,
it is worth mentioning the OSKit
<http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/oskit/>, which provides a library
supporting the specification.

Example boot loader code
========================

   The GNU GRUB (*note GRUB: (grub.info)Top.) project is a full
Multiboot-compliant boot loader, supporting all required and optional
features present in this specification. A public release has not been
made, but the test release is available from:

   <ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/hurd/src/>

   See the webpage <http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub.html>, for
more information.
