!
! bootsect.s is loaded at 0x7c00 by the bios-startup routines, and moves
! itself out of the way to address 0x90000, and jumps there.
!
! bde - should not jump blindly, there may be systems with only 512K low
! memory.  Use int 0x12 to get the top of memory, etc.
!
! It then loads 'setup' directly after itself (0x90200), and the system
! at 0x10000, using BIOS interrupts. 
!
! NOTE! currently system is at most (8*65536-4096) bytes long. This should 
! be no problem, even in the future. I want to keep it simple. This 508 kB
! kernel size should be enough, especially as this doesn't contain the
! buffer cache as in minix (and especially now that the kernel is 
! compressed :-)
!
! The loader has been made as simple as possible, and continuous
! read errors will result in a unbreakable loop. Reboot by hand. It
! loads pretty fast by getting whole tracks at a time whenever possible.
