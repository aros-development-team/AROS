You need to download  or compile a m68k (elf) cross compiler for linux
on i386.
For bootfloppy image creation you also need the emile-tools for i386.
You can download them at http://emile.sf.net/

Compilation
-----------
Compile the kernel as follows starting in AROS/

make clean
autoconf
./configure --target=mac-m68k
make

I had to manually adjust the configured m68k-elf-* tools in
AROS/bin/linux-i386/tools/ to have it compile.
The resulting binaries are placed into AROS/bin/m68k-mac/AROS
When emile is installed a bootable floppy image should be in there too.
You can write the image to floppy using dd on linux or a tool like
rawrite on Windows.
You can also use the generated .elf files with the Penguin bootloader
on MacOS.

Some Knowledge
--------------

My test machines are an LC 475 and an Quadra 700. I haven't tested on
any other machine yet.
The image doesn't work on machines without MMU, because the bootloader
needs it. Because of that its also not working on any Mac68k emulator
without MMU support.
When using the floppy boot method, no MacOS is needed.

The whole thing isn't doing a lot right now.
Its locating the machines framebuffer address through informations
passed to it from the bootloader, clearing the screen and drawing
some colored bars on it and printing some hardware info.

Its trying to initialize exec but its still failing.
I guess its related to the JUMPVEC stuff in machine.h .
