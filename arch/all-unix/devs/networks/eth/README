README for tap.device
---------------------

eth.device is a SANA-II-compliant network driver that allows AROS running in
hosted environments to access the network via the host operating system
(currently Linux only).

This driver is early alpha. Its unfinished in places, and there are probably
several groovy bugs about. 

REQUIREMENTS

 - AROS hosted running as the root user
 - A free ethernet device (ie eth0) which the driver will open in
   promiscuous mode

INSTALLATION

 - Build AROS as normal
 
 - As root, start AROS
 
    # linux/AROSBootstrap

 - Edit SYS:System/Network/AROSTCP/db/interfaces and add the
   following line:

   eth0 DEV=DEVS:networks/eth.device UNIT=0
 
 - Start AROSTCP

   > execute SYS:System/Network/AROSTCP/S/startnet

Thats it. AROS can now reach the Linux host's network device on ethN.


NOTES

The driver is extremely verbose. I'm leaving the debug output in place until I
consider the code to be stable. If you want to disable it, edit
arch/all-unix/devs/networks/tap/tap.h and redefine DEBUG to be 0, then
recompile.

The unit number and Linux interface name are linked such that opening unit #0
on the Amiga side will result in attachment to interface eth0 on the Linux
side, unit #1 -> eth1, etc. By default, the driver can handle up to 32 
units; this can be increased by changing MAX_ETH_UNITS in eth.h.

BUG REPORTING

You'll undoubtedly have problems; this is very new code. Please send reports,
feedback and other comments to me at jason.mcmullan@gmail.com

If you are having a problem, I'm probably going to ask for debug output, and
possibly steps to reproduce the problem.
