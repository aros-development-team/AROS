*
*	Description: The entry point sAcos computes the inverse cosine of
*		an input argument; sAcosd does the same except for denormalized
*		input.
*
*	Input: Double-extended number X in location pointed to
*		by address register a0.
*
*	Output: The value arccos(X) returned in floating-point register Fp0.
*
*	Accuracy and Monotonicity: The returned result is within 3 ulps in
*		64 significant bit, i.e. within 0.5001 ulp to 53 bits if the
*		result is subsequently rounded to double precision. The 
*		result is provably monotonic in double precision.
*
*	Speed: The program sCOS takes approximately 310 cycles.
*
*	Algorithm:
*
*	ACOS
*	1. If |X| >= 1, go to 3.
*
*	2. (|X| < 1) Calculate acos(X) by
*		z := (1-X) / (1+X)
*		acos(X) = 2 * atan( sqrt(z) ).
*		Exit.
*
*	3. If |X| > 1, go to 5.
*
*	4. (|X| = 1) If X > 0, return 0. Otherwise, return Pi. Exit.
*
*	5. (|X| > 1) Generate an invalid operation by 0 * infinity.
*		Exit.
