*	The entry point sGETEXP returns the exponent portion 
*	of the input argument.  The exponent bias is removed
*	and the exponent value is returned as an extended 
*	precision number in fp0.  sGETEXPD handles denormalized
*	numbers.
*
*	The entry point sGETMAN extracts the mantissa of the 
*	input argument.  The mantissa is converted to an 
*	extended precision number and returned in fp0.  The
*	range of the result is [1.0 - 2.0).
*
*
*	Input:  Double-extended number X in the ETEMP space in
*		the floating-point save stack.
*
*	Output:	The functions return exp(X) or man(X) in fp0.
*
*	Modified: fp0.
