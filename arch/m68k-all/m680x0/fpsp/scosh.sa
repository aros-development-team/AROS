*
*	The entry point sCosh computes the hyperbolic cosine of
*	an input argument; sCoshd does the same except for denormalized
*	input.
*
*	Input: Double-extended number X in location pointed to
*		by address register a0.
*
*	Output: The value cosh(X) returned in floating-point register Fp0.
*
*	Accuracy and Monotonicity: The returned result is within 3 ulps in
*		64 significant bit, i.e. within 0.5001 ulp to 53 bits if the
*		result is subsequently rounded to double precision. The
*		result is provably monotonic in double precision.
*
*	Speed: The program sCOSH takes approximately 250 cycles.
*
*	Algorithm:
*
*	COSH
*	1. If |X| > 16380 log2, go to 3.
*
*	2. (|X| <= 16380 log2) Cosh(X) is obtained by the formulae
*		y = |X|, z = exp(Y), and
*		cosh(X) = (1/2)*( z + 1/z ).
*		Exit.
*
*	3. (|X| > 16380 log2). If |X| > 16480 log2, go to 5.
*
*	4. (16380 log2 < |X| <= 16480 log2)
*		cosh(X) = sign(X) * exp(|X|)/2.
*		However, invoking exp(|X|) may cause premature overflow.
*		Thus, we calculate sinh(X) as follows:
*		Y	:= |X|
*		Fact	:=	2**(16380)
*		Y'	:= Y - 16381 log2
*		cosh(X) := Fact * exp(Y').
*		Exit.
*
*	5. (|X| > 16480 log2) sinh(X) must overflow. Return
*		Huge*Huge to generate overflow and an infinity with
*		the appropriate sign. Huge is the largest finite number in
*		extended format. Exit.
