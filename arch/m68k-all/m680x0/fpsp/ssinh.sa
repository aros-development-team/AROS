*
*       The entry point sSinh computes the hyperbolic sine of
*       an input argument; sSinhd does the same except for denormalized
*       input.
*
*       Input: Double-extended number X in location pointed to 
*		by address register a0.
*
*       Output: The value sinh(X) returned in floating-point register Fp0.
*
*       Accuracy and Monotonicity: The returned result is within 3 ulps in
*               64 significant bit, i.e. within 0.5001 ulp to 53 bits if the
*               result is subsequently rounded to double precision. The
*               result is provably monotonic in double precision.
*
*       Speed: The program sSINH takes approximately 280 cycles.
*
*       Algorithm:
*
*       SINH
*       1. If |X| > 16380 log2, go to 3.
*
*       2. (|X| <= 16380 log2) Sinh(X) is obtained by the formulae
*               y = |X|, sgn = sign(X), and z = expm1(Y),
*               sinh(X) = sgn*(1/2)*( z + z/(1+z) ).
*          Exit.
*
*       3. If |X| > 16480 log2, go to 5.
*
*       4. (16380 log2 < |X| <= 16480 log2)
*               sinh(X) = sign(X) * exp(|X|)/2.
*          However, invoking exp(|X|) may cause premature overflow.
*          Thus, we calculate sinh(X) as follows:
*             Y       := |X|
*             sgn     := sign(X)
*             sgnFact := sgn * 2**(16380)
*             Y'      := Y - 16381 log2
*             sinh(X) := sgnFact * exp(Y').
*          Exit.
*
*       5. (|X| > 16480 log2) sinh(X) must overflow. Return
*          sign(X)*Huge*Huge to generate overflow and an infinity with
*          the appropriate sign. Huge is the largest finite number in
*          extended format. Exit.
