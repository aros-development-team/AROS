*
*	Description: The entry point sAsin computes the inverse sine of
*		an input argument; sAsind does the same except for denormalized
*		input.
*
*	Input: Double-extended number X in location pointed to
*		by address register a0.
*
*	Output: The value arcsin(X) returned in floating-point register Fp0.
*
*	Accuracy and Monotonicity: The returned result is within 3 ulps in
*		64 significant bit, i.e. within 0.5001 ulp to 53 bits if the
*		result is subsequently rounded to double precision. The 
*		result is provably monotonic in double precision.
*
*	Speed: The program sASIN takes approximately 310 cycles.
*
*	Algorithm:
*
*	ASIN
*	1. If |X| >= 1, go to 3.
*
*	2. (|X| < 1) Calculate asin(X) by
*		z := sqrt( [1-X][1+X] )
*		asin(X) = atan( x / z ).
*		Exit.
*
*	3. If |X| > 1, go to 5.
*
*	4. (|X| = 1) sgn := sign(X), return asin(X) := sgn * Pi/2. Exit.
*
*	5. (|X| > 1) Generate an invalid operation by 0 * infinity.
*		Exit.
