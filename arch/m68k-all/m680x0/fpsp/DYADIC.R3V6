*
*	DYADIC.R3V6 --- DYADIC template for MCD R3V6 native C compiler
*
*	The MCD compiler is old.  It returns float and double values
*	as a double stored in d0/d1.  There is no support for single or extended
*	precision operations.  It's not clear whether the float registers
*	should be preserved, so for speed they're not.
