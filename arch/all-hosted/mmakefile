# For hosted AROS we build disk-based versions of our filesystems and partition.library
# in order to provide a way to mount disk images or real hard drives using fdsk.device
# or hostdisk.device.
# On native AROS this stuff has to be resident, so we provide 'FS' kickstart package.
# See arch/all-native/mmakefile.src.
