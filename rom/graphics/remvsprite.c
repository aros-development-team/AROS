	AROS_LH1(void, RemVSprite,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(struct VSprite *, vs, A0),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct GfxBase *, GfxBase, 23, Graphics)

/*  FUNCTION
	The VSprite is unlinked from the gel list.

    INPUTS
	vs = pointer to VSprite to be removed from the gel list

    SEE ALSO
	InitGels(), RemIBob(), graphics/gels.h

    INTERNALS
	I don't know whether it is correct to take the VSprite out of the
	ClearPath and DrawPath, but it is implemented that way.
