	AROS_LH3(void, FreeGBuffers,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(struct AnimOb *, anOb, A0),
	AROS_LHA(struct RastPort *, rp, A1),
	AROS_LHA(BOOL , db, D0),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct GfxBase *, GfxBase, 100, Graphics)

/*  FUNCTION
	Deallocate all buffers for a whole AnimOb. In particular this
	means getting buffers for
	- BorderLine
	- SaveBuffer
	- CollMask
	- ImageShadow (points to the same memory as CollMask does)
	- if db is set to TRUE the user wants double-buffering, so we need
	  - DBufPacket
	  - BufBuffer

    INPUTS
        anOb = pointer to AnimOb structure to be added to list of
	       AnimObs
	rp   = pointer to a valid RastPort with initialized GelsInfo
	       structure
	db   = TRUE when double-buffering is wanted

    RESULT

    NOTES
	A call to GetGBuffers() that resulted in a partially allocation
	of the required buffers will result in a deallocation of these
	buffers. (Possible incompatibility with the real thing, though)
