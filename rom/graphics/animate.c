/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(struct AnimOb **, anKey, A0),
	AROS_LHA(struct RastPort *, rp, A1),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct GfxBase *, GfxBase, 27, Graphics)

/*  FUNCTION
	Animate every AnimOb in the list. In particular do the following:
	- update location and velocities
	- call AnimOb's special routine if supplied
	- for every component of the Anim ob do:
	  - switch to new sequence if current sequence times out
	  - call the special routine of the component if supplied
	  - set the the coordinates of the VSprite of this
	    sequence to whatever these routines cause

    INPUT
	anKey = address of a pointer to the first AnimOb in the list
                (same address that was passed to AddAnimOb!)
	rp    = pointer to a valid RastPort structure
