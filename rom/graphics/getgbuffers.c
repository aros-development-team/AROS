	AROS_LH3(BOOL, GetGBuffers,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(struct AnimOb *, anOb, A0),
	AROS_LHA(struct RastPort *, rp, A1),
	AROS_LHA(BOOL , db, D0),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct GfxBase *, GfxBase, 28, Graphics)

/*  FUNCTION
	Allocate all buffers for a whole AnimOb. In particular this
	means getting buffers for
	- BorderLine
	- SaveBuffer
	- CollMask
	- ImageShadow (points to the same memory as CollMask does)
	- if db is set to TRUE the user wants double-buffering, so we need
	  - DBufPacket
	  - BufBuffer

    INPUTS
        anOb = pointer to AnimOb structure to be added to list of
	       AnimObs
	rp   = pointer to a valid RastPort with initialized GelsInfo
	       structure
	db   = TRUE when double-buffering is wanted

    RESULT
	TRUE, if all the memory allocations were successful, otherwise
	FALSE

    NOTES
	If an AnimOb is passed to GetGBuffers twice new buffers will
	be allocated and therefore old pointers to buffers will be
	lost in space.

	FreeGBuffers(), graphics/gels.h

    INTERNALS
	Are real VSprites possible as a part of an AnimOb?
	If yes, then different sizes of memory would have to be
	allocated for BorderLine and CollMask. Currently the
	sizes of memory allocated for this are most of the time
	too large as they are just allocated for a Bob. If this
	code is changed then the code of FreeGBuffers() will
	have to be changed, too, and this text can be erased :-))
