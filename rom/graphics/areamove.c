	AROS_LH3(ULONG, AreaMove,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(struct RastPort *, rp, A1),
	AROS_LHA(WORD             , x , D0),
	AROS_LHA(WORD             , y , D1),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct GfxBase *, GfxBase, 42, Graphics)

/*  FUNCTION
	Define a new starting point in the vector list for the following
	polygon defined by calls to AreaDraw(). The last polygon is closed
	if it wasn't closed by the user and the new starting points are
	added to the vector collection matrix.

    INPUTS
	rp - pointer to a valid RastPort structure with a pointer to
	     the previously initialized AreaInfo structure.
	x  - x-coordinate of the starting-point in the raster
	y  - y-coordinate of the starting-point in the raster

    RESULT
	error -  0 for success
	        -1 if the vector collection matrix is full
