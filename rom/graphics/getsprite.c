	AROS_LH2(WORD, GetSprite,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(struct SimpleSprite *, sprite, A0),
	AROS_LHA(WORD                 , pick  , D0),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct GfxBase *, GfxBase, 68, Graphics)

/*  FUNCTION          	
	Try to get a hardware sprite for the simple sprite manager.
	There are eight sprites available in the system and by calling
	this function you can allocate one for yourself. You have to
	call this function before talking to other sprite routines.
	If you want a 15 color sprite, you must allocate both sprites
	(see the manual!) and set the SPRITE_ATTACHED bit in the
	odd sprite's posctldata array.
	

    INPUTS
	sprite - pointer to a SimpleSprite structure
	pick   - number of the sprite (0-7) of -1 if you just want
		 the next available sprite

    RESULT
	-1 - if the selected sprite is not available (pick was 0-7) or
	     no further sprites are available (pick was -1). -1 will
	     also be found in the SimpleSprite structure.
	0-7: The sprite number of your allocated sprite. The number will
	     also be found in the SimpleSprite structure.

    NOTES

    EXAMPLE

    BUGS
	On some machines this will never return anything else than -1!
