     * At the other hand, we need some way to represent a RastPort as GC object to our graphics drivers.
     * Fortunately, RastPort has enough private space in it to embed a specially-made GC object.
     *
     * There are several restrictions in such approach:
     * 1. We must never OOP_DisposeObject() this GC. It is not a real issue, because this object is assumed
     *    to be owned by graphics.library, and only it has rights to dispose it.
     * 2. We can't use subclasses of this class. Since GC is just a data container, nobody needed to subclass
     *    it until and including now. I hope this won't ever become an issue. Additionally, with current
     *	  graphics.library design, GC objects are freely passed accross different display drivers.
     *
     * Well, so, we need to build an OOP_Object of GC class without doing any allocations.
     * Is it possible? Yes, it is. We need to know three facts in order to do this:
     * 1. OOP_Object is actually a class pointer, *preceding* instance data structure.
     * 2. GC's superclass is root class. So, its instance data has offset 0.
     * 3. As i said above, size of the complete object perfectly fits inside RastPort's private area.
