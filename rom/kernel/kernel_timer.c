/*
 * Generic support code for software emulated system timer.
 *
 * The main idea is: we have a single timer or arbitrary frequence (eclock),
 * which is used for generating timer interrupts. Its frequency can be higher
 * than reasonable VBlank frequency, so we emulate VBlank by dividing EClock
 * frequency by some integer factor.
 *
 * This code uses two variables in ExecBase, which describe the way in which the machine
 * measures time:
 *
 * VBlankFrequency    - this is the frequency with which exec VBlank handler is called.
 *                      Task scheduler's Quantum is measured in these intervals.
 * ex_EClockFrequency - this is the machine's master clock frequency. It specifies
 *                      how many EClock units is in one second. This value is provided
 *			here to be used by generic software implementation of timer.device,
 *			which simply counts ticks of our system timer. Real hardware
 *			implementations of timer.device are expected to update ex_EClockFrequency
 *			to the unit in which machine's hardware measures time.
 *
 * On native ports this file will likely be replaced by hardware-probing code.
