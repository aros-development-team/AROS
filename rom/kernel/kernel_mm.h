 * The following functions operate on 'barebone' memory allocator.
 * They assume you have appropriate privileges for the allocator to work.
 * They won't change access rights of the memory they operate on.
 *
 * This two-level design allows safe boot-time memory initialization.
 * MMU control structures take up (lots of) memory themselves, and you
 * need to know where to place them.
 * To solve this, you first initialize memory allocator, and then allocate
 * memory for MMU control structures. After the MMU is up, you can manipulate
 * protection attributes.
