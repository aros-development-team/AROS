        AROS_LH3(spinlock_t *, KrnSpinLock,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(spinlock_t *, lock, A1),
	AROS_LHA(struct Hook *, failhook, A0),
	AROS_LHA(ULONG, mode, D0),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct KernelBase *, KernelBase, 43, Kernel)

/*  FUNCTION

    INPUTS
	lock      - spinlock to lock
	failhook  - called if the lock is already held
	mode      - type of lock to obtain.

    RESULT
	returns a pointer to the spinlock "handle".

    NOTES
	The failhook is necessary, because it is not safe
	for code running in user space to spin on a shared lock.
	If a lower priority task holds the lock, it will never be released.
           Because of  this, Exec uses a hook that puts the task on
           a spinning list, to allow other code to run until the lock is
           released.  At this point the "spinning" task will wake and
           obtain the lock.
