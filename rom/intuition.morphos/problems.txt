proposals

o menu
  o I would like to have tearoff menus where a menu transforms into a window
    when you press with the leftbutton on the menubar title and move it away.
  o we should allow round edged(transparent edges) menus
  o we should allow to blend in a menu(transparent effect)
  o antialised fonts for menu texts

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Implemented proposals:

o menu
  o I think a butterfly instead of this ugly Acmd key image looks better.
  o we should allow textured backgrouns for menus
  o I would like to have sticky menus (Henes)
  o when you go over a menuitem it shouldn't create a frame but should
    just be brighten up on truecolor screens.

o title bar clock

o window bar's name should have also a center string mode

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed problems:

 o ScrollVPort and/or WaitBOVP isn't synched with vbl and create some half display
   (Henes)

 o Amiga+M/N support is missing
   (Henes)

 o personnalpaint7(aminet) can't draw a single pixel and is missing 90% of events
   (Henes)

 o MUI has problems with bordersize
   (Henes)

 o there is a problem with ced's mouseblanker. When the mouse is "off" it's not reactivated
   when for example a different ced window pops up(requester) which needs our attention.
   (Ralph) (fixed)

 o wshell cnc windows don't receive menu keys. wshell windows have no idcmp.
   As it looks to me fcomp installs an inputhandler after intuition which expects
   rawkeys+iecode_up_prefix to do something...maybe intuition sends no inputevent here
   anymore.
   (fixed)

 o reqattack's buttons don't react on lmb. There's still sth wrong with FindGadget, GM_HITTEST :((
   This was bug in ReqAttack, but... it seems that IM_HITTEST doesn't check for left,topedge
   or has some protection against garbage (RA stored pointers in there).
   (jacaDcaps)

 o wipeout doesn't work at all, crashing very early or exiting with a strange error number
   (Henes)
   AllocScreenBuffer crated wrong bitmap and dbufinfo was always set to NULL, even on success.
   ChanageScreenBuffer was not implemented at all.
   (jacaDcaps)

 o an active window is opening, another window takes the focus, the first window is draw without border
   (Henes)
   This was due to the fact that for WFLG_ACTIVATE window OpenWindow called ActivateWindow,
   which was returning immediately when there was an active gadget. Now it doesn't care about this.
   (jacaDcaps)

 o CTRL-k doesn't work in stringgadgets
   Added CTRL filtering to stringgadget class
   (Ralph)

 o lamiga-n/m seem to get passed on to the active window, so CED opens a 
   "save clip as" requester when I try to switch to WB from CED.
   (bigfoot)
   (Ralph)

 o e.g. diskmontools 3.13 by Jörg Strohmayer doesn't work with intuitionppc/gadtoolsppc
   A lot of hits to 0x746F7061 'topa' at refreshglist time, probably some gadgets are
   handled wrong
   (Frank)

 o colors aren't correct...they are somehow different..
   (Ralph)
   Frank's pre iprefs 0 color test was broken
   Also fixed missing obtainpen of the last 4 colors

 o window border refresh doesn't work properly for SMART_REFRESH window layers. Just put a
   smart refresh window in the back of another window and put it back in front again. The window
   title bar is not properly updated

 o ChangeScreenBuffer doesn't care about active gadgets (should fail if there's any!)
   (jacaDcaps)

 o dopus's/ced/other progs scrollers always look recessed
   (jacaDcaps)

 o screenmode change doesn't work
   (Ralph)
   LockPubScreen increased visitor count by 2 when locking WB screen.
   (jacaDcaps)

 o IDCMP_GADGETHELP either doesn't work or is not implemented. Programs like fxScan/iospirit use it to display some
   sort of bubble help if you stay on a button for a few seconds (Frank)

 o DOpus 4.x scrollers don't refresh properly (leaves trails)
   (CISC)
   This should not happen anymore if setting PROP_RENDER_OPTIMIZATION define to 0
   in intuition_intern.h (stegerg)

 o 1:1 don't work for window borders (still 2:1).
   (CISC)

 o the menu checkmark has a weird ratio

 o ahi's modeid requesters display wrong frequency (OHz in the slider)

 o dopus's iconify gadgets are placed too far away from others
   (Henes)

 o a window can open on the top of a menu
   (Henes)

----------------------------------------------------------------------


 o the mouse movement is dead slow
   (fixed, but 2x times too fast for some people now)

 o rmb to call menu, lmb on an entry, slide on all menu entries and release lmb, it will select only one
   Attn: AFAIR, this multiple menu selection stuff is one of the C= patents, and was not
   implemented by AROS on purpose. (Emm)

 o rmb, lmb on a menu entry, slide on the top of the menu, move the mouse outside of it, release rmb, the selection is forgoten

 o SFSdefragmentGUI: click on the resize gadget, it will be recessed forever

 o keyboard timings aren't used.
   (Ralph)

 o wb screen uses wrong memory base addresse after you have tested a different modeid in cgxmode
   (Henes)

 o Matrix screen blanker seems to break intuitionppc. Periodically memory is lost and the
   system hangs after popupmenu access. Probably some input event hacking of Matrix blanker ??
   (Frank)

 o screenmode change pops up a requester which has 2 weird centered buttongadgets
   while the left one doesn't seem to react on mouseinput on the whole length of
   the gadget
   (Ralph)

 o font requester doesn't work either
   (Ralph)

 o keyboard control of e.g. string gadgets is either utterly broken or not implemented
   (Amiga-X, tab key , keypad enter ...)

 o perfectpaint has no depth gadget
   (Henes)

 o propscroller overwrites if mfr opens in a huge dir with a lot entries.

 o a frame surrounding checkmark like in palette doesn't work...the frame is too small.

 o emm: CloseWindow sometimes locks in DeleteLayer.
   In my case it seems to happen more often when my blanker is on(seperate screen) and the blanker
   removes its window/screen.

 o int_refreshwindowframe is called with a window sometimes which window->BorderRPort's layer
   must be NULL as it crashes in LockLayerRom then...happened when called by SetWindowTitles
   in CNC:. WShell's conhandler.
   Late 2:50 thinking...only a GZZ window may have a layer in the borderrport..or do i miss
   something here ?

 o Search stringgadget in CED behaves weird "sometimes"..i usally open it and blindly enter
   text but sometimes it doesn't enter the text in the search but in the replace gadget.
   A bit weird....maybe related to the search "history,multiline?".

 o DOpus 4.x menus look horrible (colorinverted text and whatnot)
   (CISC)
   This seems to be due to old-style menus not being handled properly,
   maybe enforce NewLook (or atleast add prefs option)?

 o When Heretic2 runs on a different gfx board than the Workbench, you see a grey areas on the wb, with the same size than H2's screen.
   Maybe it's the backdrop window or a blit happening on the wrong screen.
   (Henes)

 o In ADescent, you can move the mouse in X axis as usual, but the movement are limited to a little zone in the Y axis.
   (Henes)

 o Hacks to remove wb screenbar don't work any more (because of clock?).
   (CISC)

 o When a window closes, its name isn't removed from the screenbar.
   (Henes)

 o When you move a window, there is a trail of its box if another window opens at the same time (and it deadlocks most of the times:)
   (Henes)

 o Sometimes, menus are too larges.
   (Henes)
