AROS_LH1(BOOL, FreeClass,

         /*  SYNOPSIS */
         AROS_LHA(struct IClass *, classPtr, A0),

         /*  LOCATION */
         struct IntuitionBase *, IntuitionBase, 119, Intuition)

/*  FUNCTION
    Only for class implementatores.
 
    Tries to free a class which has been created with MakeClass() in the
    first place. This will not succeed in all cases: Classes which
    still have living objects or which are still beeing used by subclasses
    can't simply be freed. In this case this call will fail.
 
    Public classes will always be removed with RemoveClass() no matter
    if FreeClass() would succeed or not. This gurantees that after the
    call to FreeClass() no new objects can be created.
 
    If you have a pointer to allocated memory in cl_UserData, you must
    make a copy of that pointer, call FreeClass() and if the call
    succeeded, you may free the memory. If you don't follow these rules,
    you might end up with a class which is partially freed.
 
    INPUTS
    classPtr - The pointer you got from MakeClass().
 
    RESULT
    FALSE if the class couldn't be freed at this time. This can happen
    either if there are still objects from this class or if the class
    is used a SuperClass of at least another class.
 
    TRUE if the class could be freed. You must not use classPtr after
    that.
 
    NOTES
    *Always* calls RemoveClass().
 
    EXAMPLE
    // Free a public class with dynamic memory in cl_UserD
 
    int freeMyClass (Class * cl)
    {
        struct MyPerClassData * mpcd;
 
        mpcd = (struct MyPerClassData *)cl->cl_UserData;
 
        if (FreeClass (cl)
        {
        FreeMem (mpcd, sizeof (struct MyPerClassData));
        return (TRUE);
        }
 
        return (FALSE);
    }
