	AROS_LH2(QUAD, SMult64,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(LONG, arg1, D0),
	AROS_LHA(LONG, arg2, D1),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct UtilityBase *, UtilityBase, 33, Utility)

/*  FUNCTION
	Compute the signed 64-bit product of arg1 * arg2.

    INPUTS
	arg1, arg2  -	32 bit signed numbers.

    RESULT
	arg1 * arg2

    NOTES
	For m68k assembly programmers, QUADs are returned in D0:D1 (with
	the high 32 bits in D0).

	The utility.library math functions are unlike all other utility
	functions in that they don't require the library base to be
	loaded in register A6, and they also save the values of the
	address registers A0/A1.

	This function is mainly to support assembly programers, and is
	probably of limited use to higher-level language programmers.

    EXAMPLE

    BUGS

    SEE ALSO
	SMult32(), UMult32(), UMult64()

    INTERNALS
	Actually handled in config/$(KERNEL)/utility_math.s

	This is essentially SMult32(), but with the code to calculate
	the product of the high 32 bits of the multiplicands.

	In fact all that is added is the 2^32 * ac term (see docs for
	    SMult32().)

	29-10-95    digulla automatically created from
