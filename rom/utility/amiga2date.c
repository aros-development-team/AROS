/*  FUNCTION
	Convert the time value given as the number of seconds since the
	1st of January 1978 (00:00:00 1.1.78), to a more useful values,
	which is easier for most people to understand. These values will
	be stored in the ClockData structure whose address is passed as
	an argument.

    INPUTS
	seconds     -	Number of seconds since 1.1.78 00:00:00
	result	    -	The ClockData structure to store the information
			in.

    RESULT
	The ClockData structure will contain the converted time values.

    INTERNALS
	Some information about some constants I use:

	     731 =  365 + 366, the number of days between 1.1.1978 and
		    1.1.1976. Using 1976 makes working out leap years
		    simpler.
	    1461 =  The number of days in four years including 1 leap year.
		    (eg 365*3 + 366)
	   86400 =  The number of seconds in one day.

	I used these as constants so that they don't have to be computed
	on the fly, or read from variables.

    HISTORY
	29-10-95    digulla automatically created from
			    utility_lib.fd and clib/utility_protos.h
	19-05-96    iaint   Wrote, with a little help from a Perl package.
	11-08-96    iaint   Updated for the new AROS format.
	17-08-96    iaint   Removed calls to unimplemented UDivMod32/UMult32
	24-02-97    iaint   Reimplemented, actually works now :)
