	AROS_LH1(struct TagItem *, CloneTagItems,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(const struct TagItem *, tagList, A0),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct UtilityBase *, UtilityBase, 12, Utility)

/*  FUNCTION
	Duplicates a TagList. The input TagList can be NULL, in which
	case an empty TagList will be returned.

    INPUTS
	tagList     -	The TagList that you want to clone

    RESULT
	A TagList which contains a copy of the TagItems contained in the
	original list. The list is cloned so that calling FindTagItem()
	on a tag in the clone will return the same value as that in the
	original list (assuming the original has not been modified).

    NOTES

    EXAMPLE
	struct TagItem *tagList, *tagListClone;

	\* Set up the original taglist tagList *\

	tagListClone = CloneTagItems( tagList );

	\* Do what you want with your TagList here *\

	FreeTagItems( tagListClone );
