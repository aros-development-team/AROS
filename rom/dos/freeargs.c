        AROS_NTLH1(void, FreeArgs,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
        AROS_LHA(struct RDArgs *, args, D1),

/*  LOCATION */
        struct DosLibrary *, DOSBase, 143, Dos)

/*  FUNCTION
        FreeArgs() will clean up after a call to ReadArgs(). If the
        RDArgs structure was allocated by the system in a call to 
        ReadArgs(), then it will be freed. If however, you allocated
        the RDArgs structure with AllocDosObject(), then you will
        have to free it yourself with FreeDosObject().

    INPUTS
        args - The data used by ReadArgs(). May be NULL, in which case,
               FreeArgs() does nothing.

    RESULT
        Some memory will have been returned to the system.
