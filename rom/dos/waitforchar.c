        AROS_LH2(LONG, WaitForChar,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
        AROS_LHA(BPTR, file, D1),
        AROS_LHA(LONG, timeout, D2),

/*  LOCATION */
        struct DosLibrary *, DOSBase, 34, Dos)

/*  FUNCTION
        Wait for a character to arrive at a filehandle. The filehandle
        can be either a console handle, or a regular file. For a regular
        file most filesystems will return a character immediately, but
        sometimes (for example, a network handler) the character may not
        have arrived.

    INPUTS
        file    - File to wait for a character on.
        timeout - Number of microseconds to wait for the character
                  to arrive.

    RESULT
        != 0    if a character arrived before the timeout expired
        == 0    if no character arrived

    NOTES
        Many filesystems do not implement this function.
