/*  FUNCTION

    Send a packet to a handler without waiting for the result. The packet will
    be returned to 'replyport'.

    INPUTS

    packet     --  the (initialized) packet to send
    port       --  the MsgPort to send the packet to
    replyport  --  the MsgPort to which the packet will be replied

    RESULT

    This function is callable from a task.
