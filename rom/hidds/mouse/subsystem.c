    NAME
	--background_subsystem--

    LOCATION
	CLID_Hidd_Mouse

    NOTES
	This class represents a "hub" for collecting input from various
	pointing devices (mice, tablets, touchscreens, etc) in the
	system. Events from all pointing devices are merged into a
        single stream and propagated to all clients.

	In order to get an access to pointing input subsystem you need to
	create an object of CLID_Hidd_Mouse class. The actual returned
        object is a singletone, you do not have to dispose it, and every
        call will return the same object pointer. After getting this object
        you can, for example, register your driver using moHW_AddDriver
        method, or enumerate drivers using moHW_EnumDrivers.

        If you wish to receive keyboard events, use objects of CLID_Hidd_Mouse
        class. This class implements the same interface as driver class, but
        represents receiver's side and is responsible for registering user's
        interrupt handler in the listeners chain. These objects are not real
        drivers and do not need to me registered within the subsystem.

    NAME

    LOCATION
        CLID_HW_Mouse

    NOTES
        A hardware driver should be a subclass of CLID_Hidd and implement IID_Hidd_Mouse
        interface according to the following rules:

        1. A single object of driver class represents a single hardware unit.
        2. A single driver object maintains a single callback address (passed to it
           using aoHidd_Mouse_IrqHandler). Under normal conditions this callback is
           supplied by CLID_HW_Mouse class.
