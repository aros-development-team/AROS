Attributes:
----------

NAME
    aHidd_BitMap_Width, ULONG, IG

FUNCTION
    Create a bitmap with this width
    or query the width. Note that most HIDD don't support to resize a bitmap.
    The width is in HIDD units. Some graphics HIDDs support text mode, then
    this is in characters. But most of the time, this will be in screen or
    printer pixels. Specifies width of bitmap to create.

NAME
    aHidd_BitMap_Depth, UBYTE, IG
	
FUNCTION
    Create a bitmap with this depth. When
    the bitmap has been created, you can query the attribute. The number of
    distinct colors is |1L << depth|. Most HIDDs will support depths like 1, 8,
    15, 16, 24 and 32 bit.

NAME
    aHidd_BitMap_Displayable, BOOL, IG
	
FUNCTION
    Create a bitmap which should later
    be displayed. When the bitmap has been created, you can query the
    attribute. On some systems, this will also display the bitmap when
    the method returns. To be safe, always call |HIDDV_Graphics_Cmd_ShowBitmap()|
    afterwards.
