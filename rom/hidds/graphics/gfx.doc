The gfx HIDD API consists of three interfaces ?
IID_Hidd_Gfx, IID_Hidd_GC and IID_Hidd_BitMap, and there
are correspondent classes for each interface.

Gfx class.
=========

When working with gfx.hidd this is the first object you get.
It allows you to create BitMap and GC (graphics context)
object. The class' methods must be overidden by HW-specific
subclasses where documented to do so.

Class ID: CLID_Hidd_Gfx
Include: <hidd/graphics.h>

Interfaces:

IID_Hidd_Gfx
------------

Methods:

NAME
    Hidd_Gfx_CreateCG
	
SYNOPSIS
Object *Hidd_Gfx_CreateGC(Object *gfxHidd, Object *bitMap, UWORD gcType);

FUNCTION
    Create a GC (gfx context) object that may be used for rendering
    into a bitmap. You can supply what type the GC should be.
    Currently available types are:
    	- vHidd_GC_Quick. The quickest type of GC, which renders
	  directly into the bitmap without any clipping, or
	  coordinate checking. It's fast, but the user must know
	  what he's doing.
	- vHidd_GC_Clipping. GC that supports clipping.
	
    You can create several GCs of different types for the same bitmap.
    
    Subclasses of this clas MUST override this call
    for the creation of vHidd_GC_Quick GCs.
    Creation of vHidd_GC_Clipping GCs may be left to this class.
    
INPUTS
    bitMap - A BitMap object onto which the GC will perform
    	     the rendering operations.
    
    gcType - Type of GC to create, currently vHidd_GC_Quick
             or vHidd_GC_Clipping.

RESULT
    gc - pointer to the newly created GC, ready for use for rendering
         operations.
    
NOTES
    Not sure if I like this API. Instead of subclasses having to
    override this method they could  somehow tell
    this class how tell this class from what class to create
    a vHidd_GC_Quick GC. For example the superclass could pass
    a aHidd_Gfx_QuickGCClass attribute to us in New().
    Alternatively we could use class posing.

/*************************/
NAME
    Hidd_Gfx_DeleteGC()
	
SYNOPSIS
    VOID Hidd_Gfx_DeleteGC(Object *gfxHidd, Object *gc)

FUNCTION
    Deletes a GC (Grpahics Contect) object previously created
    by Hidd_Gfx_CreateGC().
    
    Subclasses does not have to override this method
    unless they allocate anything additional to a gc object in
    their Hidd_Gfx_CreadeGC() implementation.
    
INPUTS
    gc - Pointer to gc object to delete. May be a GC of any type.

RESULT
    None.
