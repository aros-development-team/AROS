    NAME
        --background_hwroot--

    LOCATION
        CLID_HW_Root

    NOTES
        This class represents a root of HIDD subsystem tree. In other words, it
        represents your computer. Calling HW_EnumDrivers() on it will enumerate
        installed subsystem classes.

        By design this class is a singletone. In order to get access to it, just
        call OOP_NewObject() on it. Every call will return the same pointer to
        the same object. You do not need to call OOP_Dispose object on it. Such
        calls will simply do nothing.

        Subsystem classes need to register themselves in the tree by calling
        HW_AddDriver() on this class. The class keeps an eye on the subsystem
        usage and will allow to remove it using HW_RemoveDriver() only if the
        subsystem being removed is not in use by any other components.
