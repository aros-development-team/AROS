 * The purpose of this delay is to wait until device detection is done
 * before boot sequence enters DOS bootstrap. Without this we reach the
 * bootstrap earlier than devices are detected (and BootNodes inserted).
 * As a result, we end up in unbootable system.
 * Actually, i dislike this solution a bit. I think something else has
 * to be implemented. However i do not know what. Even if we rewrite
 * adding BootNodes, bootmenu still has to wait until all nodes are added.
 * Making device detection synchronous is IMHO not a good option, it will
 * increase booting time of our OS.
