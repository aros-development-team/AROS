        AROS_LH1(void, BeginRefresh,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
        AROS_LHA(struct Window *, window, A0),

/*  LOCATION */
        struct IntuitionBase *, IntuitionBase, 59, Intuition)

/*  FUNCTION
        Initializes optimized refreshing. It restricts redrawing to areas which
        need refreshing after a window has been moved or has changed size.

    INPUTS
        window - window which needs refreshing

    RESULT

    NOTES
        Only simple graphics.library functions are allowed between
        BeginRefresh() and EndRefresh().

        BeginRefresh()/EndRefresh() should always be called when an
        IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW message happens.

    EXAMPLE
        Somewhere in your window's event handling loop:

        case IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW:
            BeginRefresh(mywindow);
            EndRefresh(mywindow, TRUE);
            break;

    BUGS

    SEE ALSO
