/*  SYNOPSIS */
        AROS_LHA(ULONG, What, D0),

/*  LOCATION */
        struct IntuitionBase *, IntuitionBase, 69, Intuition)

/*  FUNCTION
        Locks Intuition. While you hold this lock, no fields of Intuition
        will change. Please release this as soon as possible.

    INPUTS
        What - Which fields of Intuition should be locked. The only allowed
            value for this is currently 0 which means to lock everything.

    RESULT
        The result of this function must be passed to UnlockIBase().

    NOTES
        You *must not* call this function if you have any locks on other
        system resources like layers and LayerInfo locks.
