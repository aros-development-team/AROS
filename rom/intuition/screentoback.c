        AROS_LH1(void, ScreenToBack,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
        AROS_LHA(struct Screen *, screen, A0),

/*  LOCATION */
        struct IntuitionBase *, IntuitionBase, 41, Intuition)

/*  FUNCTION
        Move a screen behind all other screens. If the screen is in a
        group, the screen will be moved behind all other screens in the
        group only. If the screen is the parent of a group, the whole
        group will be moved in the back.

    INPUTS
        screen - Move this screen.

    RESULT
        You will see the screen move behind all other screens. If some
        screen before this screen occupies the whole display, then it
        will disappear completely. If all other screens occupy only part
        of the display, the screen will appear behind the screens.
