    NAME */

    AROS_LH0(IPTR, OpenWorkBench,

/*  SYNOPSIS */

/*  LOCATION */
    struct IntuitionBase *, IntuitionBase, 35, Intuition)

/*  FUNCTION
	Attempt to open the Workbench screen.

    INPUTS
	None.

    RESULT
	Tries to (re)open WorkBench screen. If successful return value
	is a pointer to the screen structure, which shouldn't be used,
	because other programs may close the WorkBench and make the
	pointer invalid.
	If this function fails the return value is NULL.
