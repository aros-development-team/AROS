        AROS_LH3(void, MoveScreen,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
        AROS_LHA(struct Screen *, screen, A0),
        AROS_LHA(LONG           , dx, D0),
        AROS_LHA(LONG           , dy, D1),

/*  LOCATION */
        struct IntuitionBase *, IntuitionBase, 27, Intuition)

/*  FUNCTION
        Move a screen by the specified amount in X/Y direction. The
        resolution is always the screen resolution.

    INPUTS
        screen - Move this screen
        dx - Move it by this amount along the X axis (> 0 to the right,
            < 0 to the left).
        dy - Move it by this amount along the Y axis (> 0 down, < 0 up)

    RESULT
        None.

    NOTES
        Depending on other restrictions, the screen may not move as far
        as specified. It will move as far as possible and you can check
        LeftEdge and TopEdge of the screen to see how far it got.
