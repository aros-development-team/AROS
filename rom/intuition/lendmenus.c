        AROS_LH2(void, LendMenus,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
        AROS_LHA(struct Window *, fromwindow, A0),
        AROS_LHA(struct Window *, towindow, A1),

/*  LOCATION */
        struct IntuitionBase *, IntuitionBase, 134, Intuition)

/*  FUNCTION
        This function "lends" the menus of one window to another. This makes
        the menu events (e.g. menu button presses) take place in another
        window's menu (i.e. the other window's strip and screen).

        This function is used to unify two windows on different attached
        screens. (E.g. a painting program with an attached palette screen
        can open the menu on the main screen if the menu button is
        pressed on the palette screen.)

    INPUTS
        fromwindow - This window's menu events will go to another window.
        towindow - This is the window that will react on the menu actions
            of the other window. If NULL 'lending' will be turned off.

    RESULT
        None.
