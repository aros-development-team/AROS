/*  LOCATION */
        struct IntuitionBase *, IntuitionBase, 85, Intuition)

/*  FUNCTION
        Locks a public screen, thus preventing it from closing. This is
        useful if you want to put up a visitor window on a public screen
        and need to check some of the public screen's fields first -- not
        locking the screen may lead to the public screen not existing when
        your visitor window is ready.

        If you try to lock the Workbench screen or the default public screen
        and there isn't any, the Workbench screen will be automatically opened
        and locked.

    INPUTS
        name - Name of the public screen or NULL for the default public
               screen. The name "Workbench" refers to the Workbench screen.
               The name is case insensitive.

    RESULT
        A pointer to the screen or NULL if something went wrong. Failure can
        happen for instance when the public screen is in private state or
        doesn't exist.

    NOTES
        You don't need to hold the lock when your visitor window is opened as
        the pubscreen cannot be closed as long as there are visitor windows
        on it.

    EXAMPLE
        To open a visitor window which needs information from the screen
        structure of the public screen to open on, do this:
 
        if((pubscreen = LockPubScreen("PubScreentoOpenon")) != NULL)
        {
            ...check pubscreen's internal data...
            OpenWindow(VisitorWindow, pubscreen);
            UnlockPubScreen(NULL, pubscreen);
            ...use your visitor window...
            CloseWindow(VisitorWindow);
        }
