    Revision 1.13  2001/01/31 23:07:30  stegerg
    various little pubscreen related fixes/improvements.

    Revision 1.12  2000/12/10 20:57:24  stegerg
    strcmp returns 0 if the strings are identical

    Revision 1.11  2000/12/07 16:15:01  chodorowski
    Now automatically opens the Workbench screen if there is no default
    public screen or Workbench screen and the function was called with
    "Workbench" or NULL as an argument.

    Revision 1.10  2000/04/08 16:38:09  stegerg
    type cast 2nd param of FindName to (UBYTE *) to avoid
    compiler warning. Or Should instead 2nd arg of FindName()
    func be of type CONST_STRPTR?????????????????

    Revision 1.9  2000/02/01 22:48:31  bernie
    Using CONST_STRPTR for screen name

    Revision 1.8  2000/01/30 23:45:34  bernie
    Increment visitor count even for LockPubScreen(NULL); Don't expect that IntuitionBase->DefaultScreen is always non-NULL (the AutoDoc says LockPubScreen() should open the Workbench in that case, but we still don't); Add pointer checking assertions.

    Revision 1.7  1999/10/12 17:45:44  SDuvan
    Added docs, minor updates

    Revision 1.6  1999/09/12 01:48:58  bernie
    more public screens support

    Revision 1.3  1996/12/10 14:00:05  aros
    Moved #include into first column to allow makedepend to see it.

    Revision 1.2  1996/10/24 15:51:22  aros
    Use the official AROS macros over the __AROS versions.

	AROS_LH1(struct Screen *, LockPubScreen,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(CONST_STRPTR, name, A0),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct IntuitionBase *, IntuitionBase, 85, Intuition)

/*  FUNCTION

    Locks a public screen, thus preventing it from closing.
    This is useful if you want to put up a visitor window on a public screen
    and need to check some of the public screen's field first -- not locking
    the screen may lead to the public screen not existing when your visitor
    window is ready.

    If you try to lock the Workbench screen or the default public screen
    and there isn't any, the Workbench screen will be automatically opened
    and locked.

    INPUTS

    Name   --  Name of the public screen or NULL for the default public
               screen. The name "Workbench" refers to the Workbench screen.

    RESULT

    A pointer to the screen or NULL if something went wrong. Failure can
    happen for instance when the public screen is in private state or doesn't
    exist.

    NOTES

    You don't need to hold the lock when your visitor window is opened as
    the pubscreen cannot be closed as long as there are visitor windows
    on it.

    EXAMPLE

    To open a visitor window which needs information from the screen structure
    of the public screen to open on, do this:

    if((pubscreen = LockPubScreen("PubScreentoOpenon")) != NULL)
    {
        ...check pubscreen's internal data...
	OpenWindow(VisitorWindow, pubscreen);
	UnlockPubScreen(NULL, pubscreen);
	...use your visitor window...
	CloseWindow(VisitorWindow);
    }
