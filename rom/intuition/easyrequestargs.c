/*  FUNCTION
    Opens and handles a requester, which provides one or more choices.
    It blocks the application until the user closes the requester.
    Returned is a integer indicating which gadget had been selected.
 
    INPUTS
    Window - A reference window. If NULL, the requester opens on
         the default public screen.
    easyStruct - The EasyStruct structure (<intuition/intuition.h>),
             which describes the requester.
    IDCMP_Ptr - Pointer to IDCMP flags, which satisfy the requester,
            too. This is useful for requesters, which want to
            listen to disk changes, etc. The contents of this
            pointer is set to the IDCMP flag, which caused the
            requester to close. This pointer may be NULL.
    ArgList - The arguments for easyStruct->es_TextFormat.
 
    RESULT
    -1, if one of the IDCMP flags of idcmpPTR was set.
     0, if the rightmost button was clicked or an error occured.
     n, if the n-th button from the left was clicked.
