        AROS_LH2(BOOL, ModifyIDCMP,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
        AROS_LHA(struct Window *, window, A0),
        AROS_LHA(ULONG          , flags, D0),

/*  LOCATION */
        struct IntuitionBase *, IntuitionBase, 25, Intuition)

/*  FUNCTION
        This routine modifies the state of your window's IDCMP (Intuition
        Direct Communication Message Port).

        Depending on the current state in the IDCMPFlags of the window and
        the specified flags these actions are possible:

        IDCMP   flags   Action
        0       0       Nothing happens.
        0       !=0     The flags are copied in the IDCMPFlags of the window
                        and a MessagePort is created and stored in the
                        UserPort of the window.
        !=0     0       The IDCMPFlags are cleared and the MessagePort in the
                        UserPort is deleted.
        !=0     !=0     The flags are copied to the IDCMPFlags of the
                        window.

    INPUTS
        window - The window to change the IDCMPFlags in.
        flags - New flags for the IDCMPFlags of the window. See
            intuition/intuition.h for the available flags.

    RESULT
        TRUE if the change could be made and FALSE otherwise.

    NOTES
        You can set up the Window->UserPort to any port of your own
        before you call ModifyIDCMP().  If IDCMPFlags is non-null but
        your UserPort is already initialized, Intuition will assume that
        it's a valid port with task and signal data preset and Intuition
        won't disturb your set-up at all, Intuition will just allocate
        the Intuition message port half of it.  The converse is true
        as well:  if UserPort is NULL when you call here with
        IDCMPFlags == NULL, Intuition will deallocate only the Intuition
        side of the port.

        This allows you to use a port that you already have allocated:
 
        - OpenWindow() with IDCMPFlags equal to NULL (open no ports)
        - set the UserPort variable of your window to any valid port of your
          own choosing
        - call ModifyIDCMP with IDCMPFlags set to what you want
        - then, to clean up later, set UserPort equal to NULL before calling
          CloseWindow() (leave IDCMPFlags alone)  BUT FIRST: you must make
          sure that no messages sent your window are queued at the port,
          since they will be returned to the memory free pool.

        For an example of how to close a window with a shared IDCMP,
        see the description for CloseWindow().

        Intuition v50 features a WA_UserPort tag, which allows to set
        the UserPort at OpenWindow stage. Please note that using this tag
        changes the behaviour of ModifyIDCMP() slightly. Creating/disposing
        message ports is now up to the app. ModifyIDCMP(win,0) still clears
        win->UserPort pointer, but the message port is NOT disposed - you
        need to store it and dispose yourself! Also calling
        ModifyIDCMP(win,someidcmp) on a window with NULL win->UserPort will
        NOT create a new port!
