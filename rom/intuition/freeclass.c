        AROS_LH1(BOOL, FreeClass,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
        AROS_LHA(struct IClass *, iclass, A0),

/*  LOCATION */
        struct IntuitionBase *, IntuitionBase, 119, Intuition)

/*  FUNCTION
        Only for class implementatores.

        Tries to free a class which has been created with MakeClass() in the
        first place. This will not succeed in all cases: Classes which
        still have living objects or which are still being used by subclasses
        can't simply be freed. In this case this call will fail.

        Public classes will always be removed with RemoveClass() no matter
        if FreeClass() would succeed or not. This gurantees that after the
        call to FreeClass() no new objects can be created.

        If you have a pointer to allocated memory in cl_UserData, you must
        make a copy of that pointer, call FreeClass() and if the call
        succeeded, you may free the memory. If you don't follow these rules,
        you might end up with a class which is partially freed.

    INPUTS
        iclass - The pointer you got from MakeClass().

    RESULT
        FALSE if the class couldn't be freed at this time. This can happen
        either if there are still objects from this class or if the class
        is used a SuperClass of at least another class.

        TRUE if the class could be freed. You must not use iclass after
        that.

    NOTES
        *Always* calls RemoveClass().

    EXAMPLE
        // Free a public class with dynamic memory in cl_UserD

        int freeMyClass (Class * cl)
        {
            struct MyPerClassData * mpcd;

            mpcd = (struct MyPerClassData *)cl->cl_UserData;

            if (FreeClass (cl)
            {
                FreeMem (mpcd, sizeof (struct MyPerClassData));
                return (TRUE);
            }

            return (FALSE);
        }
