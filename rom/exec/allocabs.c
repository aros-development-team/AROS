/*  SYNOPSIS */
        AROS_LHA(IPTR,  byteSize, D0),
        AROS_LHA(APTR,  location, A1),

/*  LOCATION */
        struct ExecBase *, SysBase, 34, Exec)

/*  FUNCTION
        Allocate some memory from the system memory pool at a given address.

    INPUTS
        byteSize - Number of bytes you want to get
        location - Where you want to get the memory

    RESULT
        A pointer to some memory including the requested bytes or NULL if
        the memory couldn't be allocated

    NOTES

    EXAMPLE

    BUGS

    SEE ALSO
        FreeMem()

    INTERNALS
        This function may trash memory right after the allocation if it builds
        a new MemChunk there. Additionally it will trash additional area before
        and after the allocated space if mungwall is turned on. The additional
        space will be used for mungwall service data.

        We can't just disable mungwalling for this function because in this case
        FreeMem() on AllocAbs()ed region will crash (FreeMem() will expect mungwall
        header attached to the chunk and there's no way to tell which function was
        used to allocate it.
