/*  FUNCTION
	Switch to the next task which wishes to be run. This function has
	a similar effect to calling Dispatch(), however it may be called
	at any time, and will not lose the current task if it is of type
	TS_RUN.

    RESULT

    NOTES
	This function will preserve all its registers.

    INTERNALS
	If you want to have this function save all its registers, you
	should replace this function in $(KERNEL) or $(ARCH).
