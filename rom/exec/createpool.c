/*  SYNOPSIS */

	AROS_LHA(ULONG, threshSize,   D2),

/*  FUNCTION
	Create a private pool for memory allocations.

    INPUTS
	requirements - The type of the memory
	puddleSize   - The number of bytes that the pool expands
		       if it is too small.
	threshSize   - Allocations beyond the threshSize are given
		       directly to the system. threshSize must be
		       smaller than or equal to the puddleSize.

    RESULT
	A handle for the memory pool or NULL if the pool couldn't
	be created

    NOTES
	Since exec.library v41.12 implementation of pools has been rewritten
	to make use of memory protection capabilities. threshSize parameter
	is effectively ignored and is present only for backwards compatibility.

    EXAMPLE
	\* Get the handle to a private memory pool *\
	po=CreatePool(MEMF_ANY,16384,8192);
	if(po!=NULL)
	{
	    \* Use the pool *\
	    UBYTE *mem1,*mem2;
	    mem1=AllocPooled(po,1000);
	    mem2=AllocPooled(po,2000);
	    \* Do something with the memory... *\

	    \* Free everything at once *\
	    DeletePool(po);
	}
