/*  FUNCTION
        This function will allow interrupts to occur (*) after they have
        been disabled by Disable().

        Note that calls to Disable() nest, and for every call to
        Disable() you need a matching call to Enable().

        ***** WARNING *****


        Using this function is considered very harmful, and it should only
        ever be used to protect data that could also be accessed in interrupts.

        It is quite possible to either crash the system, or to prevent
        normal activities (disk/port i/o) from occuring.

    INPUTS
        None.

    RESULT
        Interrupts will be enabled again when this call returns.

    NOTES
        This function preserves all registers.

        To prevent deadlocks calling Wait() in disabled state breaks
        the disable - thus interrupts may happen again.

        As the schedulers pre-emption is interrupt driven,
        this function has the side effect of disabling
        multitasking.

        (*) On EXECSMP builds, Enable() only aplies to the processor
            it is called from. Data which needs to be protected from
            parallel access will also require a spinlock.            

    EXAMPLE
        In most userspace code, you will not want to use this function.

    BUGS
        The only architecture that you can rely on the registers being
        saved is on the Motorola mc68000 family.
