    NAME */

	AROS_LH1(BYTE, AllocSignal,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(LONG, signalNum, D0),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct ExecBase *, SysBase, 55, Exec)

/*  FUNCTION
	Allocate a given signal out of the current task's pool of signals.
	Every task has a set of signals to communicate with other tasks.
	Half of them are reserved for the system and half of them are
	free for general use. Some of the reserved signals (e.g.
	SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C) have a defined behaviour and may be used by user
	code, however.

	You must not allocate or free signals from exception handlers.

    INPUTS
	signalNum - Number of the signal to allocate or -1 if any signal
		    will do.

    RESULT
	Number of the signal or -1 if the signal couldn't be allocated.
