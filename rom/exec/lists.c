#Description: @AROS.Exec.LISTS@

<chapter title="Exec Lists">

<p>Exec offers a standard way to create lists of structures. All you
need to do is to put <code>struct Node node;</code>
as the first
field into any structure you want to collect in a list. You can
then use the macro <code>NEWLIST()</code> to initialize a structure
of the type <code>struct List</code> and insert the nodes
with <code>AddHead()</code>, <code>AddTail()</code>, 
<code>Enqueue()</code> or <code>Insert()</code>.<p>

<p>FIXME Explain other functions, how to use the macros,
give some example programs and explain how lists work.<p>
