    NAME */

	AROS_LH2(ULONG, Procure,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(struct SignalSemaphore  *, sigSem, A0),
	AROS_LHA(struct SemaphoreMessage *, bidMsg, A1),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct ExecBase *, SysBase, 90, Exec)

/*  FUNCTION
	Tries to get a lock on a semaphore in an asynchronous manner.
	If the semaphore is not free this function will not wait but
	just post a request to the semaphore. As soon as the semaphore is
	available the bidMsg will return and make you owner of the semaphore.

    INPUTS
	sigSem - pointer to semaphore structure
	bidMsg - pointer to a struct SemaphoreMessage. This should lie in
		 public or at least shared memory.

    RESULT
	Principly none. Don't know. Just ignore it.

    NOTES
	Locks obtained with Procure() must be released with Vacate().

	 *  Now, the code in ReleaseSemaphore that deals with this checks
	 *  (after clearing bit 0) whether the sr_Waiter field is NULL. If
	 *  so then it is really a SemaphoreMessage and should be returned.
	 *
	 *  Now the bad part about this is what we are doing. There are two
	 *  cases, in the Amiga case (bincompat), we are overwriting the
	 *  ln_Type, ln_Pri and (half the) ln_Name fields. In the other
	 *  case we are overwriting the ln_Name field completely. Now, in
	 *  either case this doesn't matter as they do not contain any
	 *  useful information that we haven't already claimed.
	 *
	 *  Thank goodness C is so type unsafe.
