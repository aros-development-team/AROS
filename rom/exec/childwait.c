    NAME */

	AROS_LH1(IPTR, ChildWait,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(ULONG, tid, D0),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct ExecBase *, SysBase, 126, Exec)

/*  FUNCTION
	Wait for either a specific child task, or any child task to finish.
	If you specify tid = 0, then this call will return when any child
	task exits, otherwise it will not return until the requested task
	finishes.

	Note that the tid is NOT the task control block (ie struct Task *),
	rather it is the value of the ETask et_UniqueID field. Passing in a
	Task pointer will cause your Task to deadlock.

	You must call ChildFree() on the returned task before calling
	ChildWait() again. Ie.

	    struct ETask *et;

	    et = ChildWait(0);
	    ChildFree(et->et_UniqueID);

    INPUTS
	tid -	The UniqueID of a task.

    RESULT
	Returns either the ETask structure of the child, or one of the
	CHILD_* values on error.

	This allows you to work out which of the children has exited.

    NOTES
	This function will work correctly only for child tasks that are
	processes created with NP_NotifyOnDeath set to TRUE.

	Calling ChildWait() on a task that isn't your child will result in
	a deadlock.

    EXAMPLE

    BUGS
	Be careful with the return result of this function.
