    NAME */
#include <exec/tasks.h>
#include <proto/exec.h>

	AROS_LH1(void, StackSwap,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(struct StackSwapStruct *,  sss, A0),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct ExecBase *, SysBase, 122, Exec)

/*  FUNCTION
	Changes the stack used by a task. The StackSwapStruct will contain
	the value of the old stack such that the stack can be reset to the
	previous version by another call to StackSwap().

	When the stack is swapped, the data on the stack(s) will not be
	altered, so the stack may not be set up for you. It is generally
	required that you replace your stack before exiting from the
	current stack frame (procedure, function call etc.).

    INPUTS
	sss     -   A structure containing the values for the upper, lower
		    and current bounds of the stack you wish to use. The
		    values will be replaced by the current values and you
		    can restore the values later.

    RESULT
	The program will be running on a new stack and sss will contain
	the old stack.

	Calling StackSwap() twice consecutively will effectively do
	nothing.

    NOTES
	Returning from the function that you call StackSwap() in can have
	unexpected results.

        Use of StackSwap() is deprecated on AROS; NewStackSwap() should
        be used instead. StackSwap() is only retained to provide backwards
        compatibility. On some hosted versions with strict stack checking use
        of StackSwap() may cause problems.
        By default StackSwap() will not be defined and you have to
        #define __AROS_GIMME_DEPRECATED_STACKSWAP__ before including
        <proto/exec.h>. As said above it is highly advised to change code
        to use NewStackSwap() and not define __AROS_GIMME_DEPRECATED_STACKSWAP__

    INTERNALS
	This function MUST be replaced in $(KERNEL) or $(ARCH).

       Note that you must save any state information on the stack that is
       used in the current process, for example you should really save
       return addresses.

       Note that even if you do save that information, it is not a good
       idea to return from the procedure that StackSwap() was invoked in
       as the stack will be quite incorrect.
