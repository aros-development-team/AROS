    NAME */

	AROS_LH2(LONG, UpfrontLayer,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
	AROS_LHA(LONG          , dummy, A0),
	AROS_LHA(struct Layer *, l    , A1),

/*  LOCATION */
	struct LayersBase *, LayersBase, 8, Layers)

/*  FUNCTION
        Brings a layer to the front. If this layer is a backdrop layer
        it is brought in front of all backdrop layers and behind the
        last non-backdrop layer. By clearing the BACKDROP flag of a layer
        a backdrop layer can be brought in front of all other layers.
        Parts of a simple layer that become visible are added to the 
        damage list and the REFRESH flag is set.

    INPUTS
        dummy - unused
        L     - pointer to layer

    RESULT
        TRUE  - layer was moved
        FALSE - layer could not be moved (probably out of memory)
