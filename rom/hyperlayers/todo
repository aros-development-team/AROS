- fix: parent layer should get/use layer info hook
- handling of errors: out of memory error!


- optimization: if a layer is already completely hidden
                there is no need to call _BackupPartsOfLayer() again.
- optimization: do not copy a bitmap that has the same size and
                offset as the target bitmap but rather move
                only the pointer (if possible).
