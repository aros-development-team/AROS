- fix: create BACKDROP layer in same priority (not lower priority).
       -> changes to CreatLayerTagList(), UpfrontLayer() and BehindLayer()!!!
- fix: parent layer should get/use layer info hook
- fix: add support for super bitmap layers everywhere.
   - when layer is enlarged (might already work automatically when 
     implemented in helper routines)
   - in _BackupPartsOfLayer()
   - in _ShowPartsOfLayer()
   - in _ShowLayer()
     - watch Scroll layer variable!!!
- make _ShowPartsOfLayer call _CopyClipRectsToClipRects instead of
  implementing the same routine again.
- handling of errors: out of memory error!


- optimization: if a layer is already completely hidden
                there is no need to call _BackupPartsOfLayer() again.
- optimization: do not copy a bitmap that has the same size and
                offset as the target bitmap but rather move
                only the pointer (if possible).

- New features: let shape be changed:   ChangeLayerShape(newshape) 
                     much code similar to MoveSizeLayer() !!!
                     -> write common code routine!
                scale a layer and its contents:
                     ScaleLayer(factor,numerator,denominator, fixx, fixy) (see ScalerDiv) 
                     use BitMapScale()
                make invisible layer visible and
                     vice versa : ChangeLayerVisibility(TRUE/FALSE)
