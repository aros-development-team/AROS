- fix: parent layer should get/use layer info hook
- handling of errors: out of memory error!


- optimization: if a layer is already completely hidden
                there is no need to call _BackupPartsOfLayer() again.
- optimization: do not copy a bitmap that has the same size and
                offset as the target bitmap but rather move
                only the pointer (if possible).

- New features: let shape be changed:   ChangeLayerShape(newshape) 
                     much code similar to MoveSizeLayer() !!!
                     -> write common code routine!
                scale a layer and its contents:
                     ScaleLayer(factor,numerator,denominator, fixx, fixy) (see ScalerDiv) 
                     use BitMapScale()
