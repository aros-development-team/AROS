   PURPOSE
       A usbhardware.device provides an API to various hardware
       implementations of USB host controllers. According to the USB specs,
       it may be referenced best as the host controller driver (HDC).

       This hardware API is used by the Poseidon USB protocol stack to
       'talk' to the USB hardware.

       This document is dated to 14-Feb-07 09:26:22.

   OVERVIEW
       The abstraction level is that of the transaction layer: the device
       must be able to send a series of packets to the USB and receive
       and reassemble multiple packets from the USB.

       USB protocol error recovery is done inside the device (NAK handling,
       retry on error) without explicit interaction from the caller.

       The device must support the four transfer types interrupt, control,
       bulk and isochroneous, it must be able to handle lowspeed devices
       as well as fullspeed devices.

       Also, USB constraints on the bus bandwidth allocation should be
       followed.

   ROOT HUB
       The root hub must appear after a bus reset as default device on the
       bus with address 0. It should have the ability to be configured like
       any external hub. If your hardware does not provide a standard USB
       hub device, you will have to emulate the root hub functionality. See
       the USB specifications (chapter 11) for details.

       You must at least support the following standard descriptors:
       Device Descriptor, Configuration Descriptor, Interface Descriptor,
       Endpoint Descriptor, and Hub Descriptor. Other supported standard
       requests and hub class requests must include ClearHubFeature,
       ClearPortFeature, GetHubDescriptor, GetHubStatus, GetPortStatus,
       SetHubFeature, and SetPortFeature.

       The hub requires to have an interrupt endpoint that returns the
       status on a change of the port features. If the hardware allows more
       efficient status check, interrupt requests to this endpoint can also
       be queued and emulated of course.

       For USB 2.0, the root hub might not get the UHFF_HIGHSPEED bit set
       for the first transactions. Normally, this should not be a problem,
       but cater for this (see below).

   DATA SEQUENCE TOGGLES
       Your driver has to check for correct DATA0/1 PID schemes as
       specified in the USB specs. You have to keep track of the outgoing
       toggle bits. Toggles are reset for an endpoint if a
       ClearFeature(Endpoint_Halt) is successfully sent.
       If SetAddress is sent, you must clear all toggle bits for all 16
       possible endpoints of the target device.

       Please be sure to get this right and TEST it. This must be working
       for both BULK and INTERRUPT transfers. Control transfers keep track
       of their toggle bits within the transfer.

   QUEUEING
       Multiple requests to the very same endpoint of a device must be
       queued in order (instead of being executed in parallel). This means
       you have to keep track of the currently scheduled IORequests for
       each endpoint.

   NAK TIMEOUT
       It is essential to implement the NAK TIMEOUT feature for BULK,
       INTERRUPT and even for CONTROL transfers. Without this, several
       higher level class drivers will appear to hang until the device is
       removed in certain error cases. On successfully received packets,
       the NAK TIMEOUT timer needs to be reset.

   USB 2.0
       With the emergence of USB 2.0, Poseidon has added support for this by
       extending the IORequest structure slightly with V3.x. New flags
       include UHFF_HIGHSPEED (which has been there since the beginning)
       and UHFF_SPLITTRANS. Poseidon V3.6 also adds UHFF_MULTI_1,
       UHFF_MULTI_2 and UHFF_MULTI_3 and fixes some bugs.

       The new fields iouh_SplitHubAddr and iouh_SplitHubPort are filled
       for USB 2.0 lowspeed and fullspeed split transactions. Note that
       these fields are wrong for versions before V3.6 in the case you
       have USB devices after a USB 1.1 hub after an USB 2.0 hub.

       If your root hub is USB 2.0, Poseidon will not know this until it
       reads a USB 2.0 version number from the device descriptor. Hence,
       it will not use UHFF_HIGHSPEED during enumeration of the root hub.
       However, this is not a problem because the root hub can assume
       highspeed transactions unless the UHFF_SPLITTRANS bit is set for
       downstream low- and fullspeed USB 1.1 devices.

       The iouh_Interval field will use units of ms for USB 1.1 or units
       of µFrames for highspeed transfers. It will not store x for 2^x,
       but the real value 2^x.

   NOTES
       The device should support multiple units whenever more than one
       host controller of the supported type may be mounted. It is
       recommended that units are opened on an exclusive basis.

       All fields except the iouh_Actual, io_Error, iouh_State and
       iouh_ExtError fields shall not be modified by the device driver.

       With the V2 driver structures available in Poseidon V3.x and higher,
       iouh_DriverPrivate1 and iouh_DriverPrivate2 are for your drivers
       private use and can store anything you like.

       Data should be transferred via DMA on hardware implementations where
       this is possible. Please take care of alignments and data field
       lengths. While it normally should be the case that iouh_Data is
       aligned on an even address, for bulk transfers maybe even on
       a longword address, this is not guaranteed. Also, the length may
       be of any odd value. Do not trash data behind the buffer.

       Be sure that the driver is able to send 0-bytes packets and
       transfers accordingly. For OUT transfers, respect the
       UHFF_NOSHORTPKT flag whenever the size of the transfer is a multiple
       of iouh_MaxPktSize.

       Also notice, that iouh_MaxPktSize does not have to be a power of
       two for interrupt or iso endpoints for your arithmetics.

   NAME
        CMD_RESET -- reset the hardware to a predefined state

   FUNCTION
        CMD_RESET performs a hardware reset cycle. The hardware then is in a
        predefined state. This will also cause a reset on the USB and the
        bus going into operational state after about 50ms.

   NAME
        UHCMD_BULKXFER -- start a bulk transfer to or from the bus

   FUNCTION
        Starts a bulk transfer with the amount of data specified. The
        direction of the transfer (host to device or device to host) is
        determined by the setting in the iouh_Dir field.

        The data itself is split into packets of iouh_MaxPktSize length.
        For IN-transactions, iouh_Data holds a pointer to the buffer to be
        filled, for OUT-transactions, iouh_Data is a pointer to the data
        to send to the device.

        In case of an error, the transfer will be retried up to three times.

   INPUTS
        mn_ReplyPort - pointer to message port that receives I/O request
                       if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear
        io_Device    - pointer to device node, must be set by (or copied from
                       I/O block set by) OpenDevice() function
        io_Unit      - pointer to unit node to use, set by OpenDevice()

                            UHFF_HIGHSPEED for high speed USB2.0 devices.
                            full speed devices will be assumed otherwise.
                            UHFF_SPLITTRANS for low or fullspeed devices
                            behind a USB 2.0 hub. iouh_SplitHubAddr and
                            iouh_SplitHubPort are set accordingly.
                            UHFF_MULTI_1, UHFF_MULTI_2, UHFF_MULTI_3
                            indicating the number of transactions per µFrame
                            for highspeed transfers.
                            UHFF_NOSHORTPKT will not send terminating short
                            packets (if the transfer length is a multiple
                            of iouh_MaxPktSize). This allows you to create
                            a continous bulk stream with multiple requests.
                            UHFF_NAKTIMEOUT will enable the NAK timeout
                            feature (see below).
                            If UHFF_ALLOWRUNTPKTS is set, the request will
                            not return UHIOERR_RUNTPACKET in any case. You
                            should check iouh_Actual for the amount of data
                            transferred.
        iouh_Dir          - either UHDIR_IN for device to host transfers
                            or UHDIR_OUT for host to device transfers.
        iouh_DevAddr      - device address from 0 to 127.
        iouh_Endpoint     - endpoint number from 0 to 15.
        iouh_MaxPktSize   - maximum size of a packet for this endpoint.
        iouh_Data         - pointer to a buffer to transport the data.
        iouh_Length       - number of bytes to transfer.
        iouh_SplitHubAddr - for split transactions only: the hub device
                            address from 0 to 127.
        iouh_SplitHubPort - for split transactions only: the hub port number
                            the USB 1.1 device is connected to from 0 to 255.
        iouh_NakTimeout   - if UHFF_NAKTIMEOUT is enabled, this specifies
                            the time in milliseconds until the request will
                            be retired with UHIOERR_NAKTIMEOUT due to the
                            endpoint constantly denying the request with
                            NAKs. This can be used to avoid hangs on a broken
                            USB unit. 1000 (1 second) is a reasonable value.


   OUTPUTS
        iouh_Actual  - actual bytes transferred.
        io_Error     - if something went wrong, you will find a non-null
                       value here, indicating the error.

   NAME
        UHCMD_CONTROLXFER -- start a control transfer to or from the bus

   FUNCTION
        Starts a control transfer, containing a Setup phase, optional
        Data phases (in or out) and the final Status phase.

        The setup stage contains of a 8 byte packet, with the USB standard
        fields bmRequestType, bRequest, wIndex, wValue and wLength.

        If iouh_Length is greater than zero, a data phase is initiated and
        the data is split into packets smaller or equal of iouh_MaxPktSize.

        The direction of the transfer (buffer to device or device to buffer)
        is determined by the most significant bit of the bmRequestType field
        in the setup packet.

        Finally, in the status stage the host controller will send a zero
        bytes data packet to terminate the control transfer.

        In case of an error, the transfer will be retried up to three times.

   INPUTS
        mn_ReplyPort - pointer to message port that receives I/O request
                       if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear

                            should check iouh_Actual for the amount of data
                            transferred.

   NAME
        UHCMD_INTXFER -- installs an interrupt transfer to or from the bus

   FUNCTION
        Installs an interrupt transfer. If no data is to be sent or the
        target endpoint does not accept the packet, it will retry to
        send the packets with the given time interval in iouh_Interval
        until it succeeds.

        The direction of the transfer (host to device or device to host) is
        determined by the setting in the iouh_Dir field.

        The data itself is split into packets of iouh_MaxPktSize length,
        although in normal cases you will not request packets larger than
        iouh_MaxPktSize.

        For IN-transactions, iouh_Data holds a pointer to the buffer to be
        filled, for OUT-transactions, iouh_Data is a pointer to the data
        to send to the device.

        In case of an error, the transfer will be retried up to three times.
        This does not include the reception of NAK pakets, which does not
        decrement the retry count.

   NOTE
        An Interrupt transfer request will only return if the device actually
        sends the data or if an error occurs. If you do DoIO(), you might get
        blocked out, so better do asynchroneous calls like SendIO().

   INPUTS

                            UHFF_NOSHORTPKT will not send terminating short
                            packets (if the transfer length is a multiple

                            If UHFF_ALLOWRUNTPKTS is set, the request will
                            not return UHIOERR_RUNTPACKET in any case. You
                            should check iouh_Actual for the amount of data

        iouh_Length       - number of bytes to transfer.
        iouh_Interval     - interval in milliseconds for the request to be
                            retried in case of a NAK. For highspeed, this
                            value is in number of µFrames (units of
                            125µsecs).

        iouh_NakTimeout   - if UHFF_NAKTIMEOUT is enabled, this specifies
                            the time in milliseconds until the request will
                            be retired with UHIOERR_NAKTIMEOUT due to the

                            NAKs. This can be used to avoid hangs on broken
                            USB unit 1000 (1 second) is a reasonable value.

        iouh_Actual  - actual bytes transferred.
        io_Error     - if something went wrong, you will find a non-null
                       value here, indicating the error.

   NAME
        UHCMD_ISOXFER -- start an isochronous transfer to or from the bus

   FUNCTION
        Starts an isochronous transfer with the amount of data specified.
        The direction of the transfer (host to device or device to host) is
        determined by the setting in the iouh_Dir field.

        The data itself is split into packets of iouh_MaxPktSize length.
        For IN-transactions, iouh_Data holds a pointer to the buffer to be
        filled, for OUT-transactions, iouh_Data is a pointer to the data
        to send to the device.

        Isochronous transfer are normally used for large, time-critical
        data which does not need to be transferred reliably.

        In case of an error, the transfer will NOT be retried at all and
        io_Error will contain the error number.

   INPUTS

                       if the quick flag (IOF_QUICK) is clear

                            UHFF_NOSHORTPKT will not send terminating short
                            packets (if the transfer length is a multiple
                            of iouh_MaxPktSize). This allows you to create
                            a continous bulk stream with multiple requests.
                            If UHFF_ALLOWRUNTPKTS is set, the request will
                            not return UHIOERR_RUNTPACKET in any case. You
                            should check iouh_Actual for the amount of data

                            the USB 1.1 device is connected to from 0 to 255.
