Known bugs and missing features:

* Memory resources not handled at all.

* If an independent descriptor follows after dependent functions,
  the descriptor numbers will be wrong.

* Cards with only 10 bit IO decoding will not reserve IO areas where
  a15-a10 != 0.  However, since Windows does not allow this either, this
  should really not be an issue.

* Creative's SB AWE32 PnP is broken.  ISA-PnP knows this and corrects the
  PnP data.  However, the current fix is hardcoded to use IO addreses
  0x0620, 0x0A20 and 0x0E20, even though they are in fact relocatable.

* For each configured logical device, ISA-PnP should be able to run a 
  shell script with information about the resources allocated. For example,
  a shell script could create the ENV:SANA2/gg_ne2000.config_0 file
  automatically.
