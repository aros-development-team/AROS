Overview
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This is an implementation of (parts of) the Plug and Play ISA Specification
version 1.0a for AmigaOS.  The bridge card GG2 Bus+ is supported.

For a list of bugs and missing features, see BUGS.

The code LGPL (see COPYING.LIB), which means that there are no restrictions
on code that uses the provided API (see below), but any modifications to or
derivates of ISA-PnP itself must stay LGPL.

Installation
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Just drop the binary and the icon in the SYS:Expansion drawer and run
C:BindDrivers (or reboot).

Usage
¯¯¯¯¯
The following tool types are available, in addition to the required PRODUCT
tooltype (that BindDrivers uses)

* DISABLE_CARD=<card id>
  DISABLE_CARD=<card id>/<serial number>

  Disables a card completely.  No resources will be assigned this card
  during the resource allocation phase.

* DISABLE_DEVICE=<device id>
  DISABLE_DEVICE=<card id>:<logical device number>
  DISABLE_DEVICE=<card id>/<serial number>:<logical device number>

  Disables a logical device.  No resources will be assigned this device
  during the resource allocation phase.

* LEGACY_DEVICE=<device id> [ IO=<address>/<length> [ IO=...] ... ]
                [ DMA=<channel> [DMA=...] ... ] [ IRQ=<int> [IRQ=...] ... ]

  Adds a non-PnP device to the resource database. All non-PnP devices must
  be registered in order to avoid resource allocation conflicts.

The ISA-PnP binary itself can also be run from the command line.  It uses
the following template:

SHOWCONFIG/S,SHOWOPTIONS/S,REMOVE/S

SHOWCONFIG will display information about all cards found, and what
resources they have allocated.

If the SHOWOPTIONS switch is given as well, information about what
resources each device requires.  Can be useful when conflicts occur and you
need to manualy find out what logical device to disable.

REMOVE should only be used for debug purposes.  It is very dangerous!  The
isapnp.resource (see below) will be removed from the system.  Any drivers
or applications currently using it will crash instantly!


The API
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ISA-PnP installs a Exec resource named "isapnp.resource", that provides a
few functions that can be used by drivers and applications to find PnP ISA
cards and logical devices, gain exclusive access to them and a set of
helper functions to access registers and memory on the ISA bus.

The API is not final, not finished and probably not working either.
