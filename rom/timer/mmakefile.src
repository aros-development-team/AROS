# \item{LIBNAME} The lowercase name of the library (without the extension).
#	This is used to help derive some filenames.
#
# \item{ULIBNAME} This also contains the library name, but with the correct
#	case (the same as found in the library base name).
#
# \item{OSMODULE} The name of the file which is created when compiling to
#	a target with module files. In this library it is expansion.library.
#
# \item{FILES} This is a list of all files (without the .c) that
#	contain internal functions of the library. You do not need to include
#	the library init, function-table or end files.
#
# \item{FUNCTIONS} This is a list of all the functions that make
#	up the library. The mmakefile will strip all the files in
#	this list for which a special CPU dependant version exists.
#	This list is concatenated into the file functions.c before
#	compilation for a speed boost.

#	to create a monolithic kernel file, you do not need to specify
#	any libs here (as they will be added later). If you want the
#	module to be separate (like AROSfA) you should specify the
