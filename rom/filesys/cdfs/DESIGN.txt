Principle of operation:

Public Semaphore 'CDFS':
    * Alias of (struct CDFS *)
    * Present while at least one CDFS device is running, or at least one
      volume is still in the DOS Volume list.

On inital call to the CDFS handler, CDFS will search for a 
semaphore named 'CDFS'. If not present, it will create one.

A new CDFSDevice is then created, and an IORequest opened.

A mount is attempted, and the detected volume is checked against
any volume in CDFSBase->cb_Volumes. If found, it is patched to
use the new task, otherwise if the mount succeeds a new CDFSVolume
is created and attached to the CDFSDevice.
