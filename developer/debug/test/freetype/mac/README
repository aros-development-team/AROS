This folder contains supporting code and CodeWarrior Pro 4 project
files to build the FreeType demo programs ftlint and ftview for MacOS.

Building
To build these apps, you'll first need to build the FreeType library
(see config/mac). Be sure to unpack the resource.hqx file; it contains
two resource files that are needed for ftlint and ftview. The
applications get built in the demos/bin folder.

Notes
Since the Mac doesn't have the notion of argc/argv, we'll emulate
this: each file dropped onto the application will be translated
to a command line argument. Both ftlint and ftview take a ppem
value as their first command line argument: for the Mac version
this has been hard-coded into the source. Also: the additional
options for ftview cannot be set.

Appendix
Makefile, ftoldmac.m68k_far.make.txt, ftoldmac.ppc_classic.make.txt
and ftoldmac.c are for commandline program "ftoldmac" to test MacOS
specific API, written by suzuki toshiya. On MacOS X, you can build
ftoldmac by "make -C mac" in the top directory of ft2demos. Also
you can generate MPW makefiles by "make -C mac makefiles", in MacOS
X commandline.

Have fun with FreeType on the Mac!
